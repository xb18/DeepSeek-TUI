# Third-party notices

CodeWhale is MIT licensed (see [`LICENSE`](../LICENSE)). Portions of it are
adapted from other open-source projects. Their copyright and permission
notices are reproduced here, and each adapted file carries an attribution
header pointing back to its origin.

Rust crate dependencies are covered by `cargo deny` (see [`deny.toml`](../deny.toml))
and are not duplicated here; this file records source-level adaptations, where
the licence obligation travels with the code rather than with a package.

## pi-mono — credential resolution design

- **Project:** pi-mono (<https://github.com/earendil-works/pi-mono>)
- **Author:** Mario Zechner
- **Licence:** MIT
- **Used in:** `crates/tui/src/credentials/` and
  `crates/tui/src/config/credential_resolve.rs`
- **What was taken:** the design of `packages/ai/src/auth/` — one type-tagged
  credential per provider, `modify` as the only serialized write path, a single
  stated precedence rule enforced in one place, an injectable auth context, and
  a resolution result that names its source. This is a design port into
  idiomatic synchronous Rust over CodeWhale's existing stores, not a
  line-for-line copy; several doc comments are adapted closely.

## Other source-level adaptations

These predate this file. Each already names its origin in a header comment on
the adapting file; they are listed here so the set is discoverable from one
place. Their licence text has not been reproduced below — that is a gap, not a
claim that none is required.
