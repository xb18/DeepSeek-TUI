//! Runtime for an **exact** named Fleet (`schema = "exact"`).
//!
//! The saved Fleet is the Fleet that runs. At Workflow start the definition is
//! read from the ordinary fleet search roots, every worker route is
//! **preflighted and frozen**, the attached Reasoning Router service is
//! resolved, and the whole thing is captured into an immutable
//! [`FleetSnapshot`] projected onto the roster/profile machinery the in-process
//! spawn path already uses.
//!
//! Five invariants govern everything below.
//!
//! 1. **Routes freeze first, and are checked while freezing.** Provider
//!    identity, canonical wire model, endpoint, local credential readiness, and
//!    reasoning capability are all resolved before the Workflow starts — and
//!    certainly before any Router is asked anything. Nothing downstream may
//!    move them: not a task option, not the Router.
//! 2. **Admission comes before cost.** A task is resolved against the roster,
//!    checked against gates, and given a concurrency slot *before* the Router
//!    is called. A rejected or capacity-blocked task spends no Router tokens
//!    and discloses nothing to a Router's provider.
//! 3. **Auto is a reasoning decision, and the attached Router makes it.**
//!    `reasoning = "auto"` always goes to the Fleet's Reasoning Router — no
//!    provider-native-adaptive bypass, no legacy model routing, no local
//!    keyword heuristic. A manual tier calls no Router at all.
//! 4. **Ceilings narrow the real child.** The saved permission ceiling is
//!    intersected with the live parent posture and turned into an actual tool
//!    policy the child runtime enforces — not a label on a receipt.
//! 5. **Receipts are truthful and content-free.** The tier a selector picked,
//!    the control a provider actually receives, and what a Router cost are
//!    recorded separately; task text never is.
