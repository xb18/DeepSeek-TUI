//! Fleet roster — the persistent, inspectable party of named agent roles.
//!
//! The roster merges four layers into one config-backed lineup shared by
//! model-spawned sub-agents and fleet dispatch (#fleet-roster cutover
//! (v0.8.67)):
//!
//! - built-in members (the default party, always available; every canonical
//!   dispatch posture — worker/scout/planner/reviewer/builder/verifier/
//!   consultant/custom — is seeded here, #5285),
//! - `[fleet.profiles]` entries from config.toml,
//! - personal `$CODEWHALE_HOME/agents/*.toml` profile files,
//! - workspace `.codewhale/agents/*.toml` profile files.
//!
//! Precedence is Workspace > Personal > Config > Plugin > BuiltIn, merged by id. Loading never
//! fails the session: an unreadable workspace profile dir degrades to the
//! built-in + config layers with a log line.
//!
//! Two guardrails (#5098):
//!
//! - Shadowing is recorded, not silent: when a higher layer displaces a
//!   lower-precedence file for the same id, the roster keeps a
//!   [`ShadowedProfile`] receipt (logged at load, badged in the roster view)
//!   so an edit in the losing layer is visibly ignored rather than dropped.
//! - Project-scope profiles (`.codewhale/agents/*.toml`) join the roster only
//!   when project-level config is trusted for the launch; `--no-project-config`
//!   opts the whole layer out, same as `.codewhale/config.toml` (#485).
