//! Unified context-budget math for the TUI.
//!
//! Given a model's context window, the current input token estimate, and a
//! configured output cap, [`ContextBudget`] derives the four numbers the rest
//! of the app needs to reason about a turn:
//!
//!   * **available input budget** — how many input tokens may still be spent
//!     after reserving room for the model's output;
//!   * **output token cap** — the output reservation actually used to compute
//!     that budget (clamped so it never starves the window);
//!   * **compaction trigger** — the input-token level at which compaction
//!     should be suggested (default: ~75% of the full window, clamped to the
//!     spendable input ceiling);
//!   * **[`PressureLevel`]** — a coarse Low/Medium/High/Critical signal the UI
//!     can render without re-deriving thresholds.
//!
//! This module is the budget-math *foundation*. It is intentionally pure (no
//! I/O, no clock, no engine/config types) so it can be unit-tested in isolation.
//! Its consumers live outside it and call in, never the reverse: `route_budget`
//! and `core::engine::context` for [`ContextBudget`], `context_report` for
//! [`PressureLevel`].
//!
//! ### Route ceilings stay independent
//!
//! A route can publish a total context window, an output ceiling, and a
//! separate input ceiling. [`ContextBudget::new_with_input_limit`] intersects
//! all three without treating one as a substitute for another: the output
//! reservation is the exact route-effective wire request, the total-window
//! arithmetic remains saturating, and a concrete input limit clamps the final
//! spendable ceiling and compaction trigger.

// This module IS wired. `ContextBudget` is consumed by `route_budget.rs` and
// `core/engine/context.rs`; `PressureLevel` by `context_report.rs`. It sits on
// the do-not-delete list in AGENTS.md because a blanket `allow(dead_code)` here,
// plus a comment that used to claim the module was "not yet referenced," taught
// several dead-code audits to propose deleting a live file. The suppression is
// now `#[cfg_attr(not(test), expect(dead_code))]` on the three methods unused
// outside tests, so a suppression that stops matching the lint fails the
// build instead of hiding behind a module-wide waiver. Tests call them, so
// a bare `#[expect(dead_code)]` would be unfulfilled under `cfg(test)`.
