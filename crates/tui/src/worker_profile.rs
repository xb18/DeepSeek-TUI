//! Worker runtime profile — the per-role capability contract for a CodeWhale
//! worker (#3217, #3211, #3213, and the child-permission-intersection issues
//! #414 / #426 / #1186).
//!
//! This is the **Workflow substrate**: every detached worker — whether launched
//! as an `agent` sub-agent or a Fleet worker — should run under a profile
//! that bounds what it may do (permissions, shell access, tool scope, model
//! route, recursion budget, foreground/background). A child profile is always
//! **derived** from its parent and can never escalate beyond it.
//!
//! Scope: this module defines the contract and the parent→child derivation with
//! tests. `agent` and Fleet worker records now build and persist these
//! profiles so parent-visible worker projections have a single capability
//! contract. Runtime enforcement of every declared field remains incremental
//! follow-up work (#3217).

#![allow(dead_code)] // foundation: consumers are wired in a follow-up (#3217).
