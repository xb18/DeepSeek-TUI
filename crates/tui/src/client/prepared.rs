//! The single prepared-outbound-request seam shared by production dispatch
//! and `/preview-request` (#1004, #3928).
//!
//! Every **primary agent turn** — `LlmClient::create_message` and
//! `create_message_stream`, in Chat Completions, Anthropic Messages, and
//! OpenAI Responses alike — reaches the wire through
//! [`crate::client::DeepSeekClient::prepare_outbound_request`], which returns a
//! [`PreparedOutboundRequest`]. The transports send it; the preview command
//! describes it. Because there is exactly one builder, a preview cannot
//! report a request different from the one a turn would send.
//!
//! Scope, stated plainly: this is *not* every outbound request Codewhale
//! makes. Chat-dialect translation builds its own small fixed body, and FIM,
//! speech, provider-native search, model listing, and the auto-router
//! classifier are separate calls with separate shapes. They are auxiliary and
//! are not described by the request manifest. See `docs/PREVIEW_REQUEST.md`.
//!
//! Nothing in this module performs I/O, mutates client state, or reads the
//! filesystem. It is safe to call on any thread at any time.
//!
//! The seam concept — prepare the exact outbound body once, then let both the
//! sender and the inspector consume it — is harvested from PR #1099
//! (`build_sanitized_chat_completion_body`) by TaoMu (GTC2080). The
//! implementation here is written against the current multi-dialect client.
