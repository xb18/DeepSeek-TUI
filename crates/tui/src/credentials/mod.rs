//! Provider credentials: one type-tagged credential per provider, one write

//! The design of this module is ported from **pi-mono** by Mario Zechner

//!
//! | pi-mono file                              | ported into                                    |
//! |-------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
//! | `packages/ai/src/auth/types.ts`           | [`Credential`], [`CredentialStore`], [`AuthContext`] |
//! | `packages/ai/src/auth/credential-store.ts`| [`store::InMemoryCredentialStore`]             |
//! | `packages/ai/src/auth/context.ts`         | [`context::ProcessAuthContext`]                |
//! | `packages/ai/src/auth/resolve.ts`         | `crate::config::credential_resolve`            |
//!
//! This is a **design port into idiomatic Rust, not a line-for-line copy**.
//! pi's module is async TypeScript over a `Provider` record with a single
//! `auth.json`; CodeWhale's is synchronous Rust over `ApiProvider` and the
//! several pre-existing on-disk stores (secret store, config file, ambient
//! environment, externally consented CLI credential files). The four ideas
//! taken verbatim in spirit are: one type-tagged credential per provider,
//! `modify` as the only serialized write path, one stated precedence rule in
//! one place, and every resolution carrying a human-readable source label.
//! Several doc comments are adapted closely enough that the MIT permission
//! notice travels with them, reproduced below.

//! Nothing in this module renders or logs secret material. [`Credential`]
//! deliberately has a hand-written [`std::fmt::Debug`] that prints only the
//! variant tag, so a credential cannot reach a log line through `{:?}` on a
//! surrounding struct.
