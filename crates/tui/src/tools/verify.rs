//! `verify` — agent-callable adversarial self-critique (#4196).
//!
//! This tool lets the agent DECIDE to spend extra test-time compute on a
//! self-review of its own recent work before claiming a change done. It runs
//! an INDEPENDENT adversarial critic pass at elevated reasoning (High/Max,
//! regardless of the session tier) whose job is to REFUTE the agent's claim —
//! surfacing correctness gaps, missed requirements, and edge cases as
//! structured findings the agent must then address.
//!
//! # Why elevated reasoning is the mechanism
//!
//! The critic request explicitly sets `reasoning_effort` to a high tier
//! ([`VerifyTool::critic_effort`], default [`ReasoningEffort::Max`]). Elevated
//! reasoning IS the test-time-compute lever, so the critic never inherits a low
//! session tier — [`build_critic_request`] threads the effort onto the outgoing
//! [`MessageRequest`], which the client forwards to the provider.
//!
//! # Bounded / no runaway (hard requirement)
//!
//! A verify call must not be able to trigger another verify. Two independent
//! guards enforce this:
//!
//! 1. **Structural (primary):** the critic is a single model call with
//!    `tools: None` (see [`build_critic_request`]). With no tools of any kind,
//!    the critic literally cannot invoke `verify` — recursion is impossible by
//!    construction, not by a denylist that could be forgotten.
//! 2. **Re-entry guard (defense in depth):** [`VerifyTool::execute`] refuses if
//!    it is entered while a critique is already in progress on the same task
//!    (tracked via the [`static@VERIFY_ACTIVE`] task-local). This protects any
//!    future path that might run the critic inside a tool loop.
//!
//! # Relationship to neighbouring tools
//!
//! - `review` critiques a specific target (file/diff/PR) as a code review.
//! - `run_verifiers` executes external test/build gates (pytest, cargo, …).
//! - `verify` (this tool) is an adversarial reasoning pass over a *claim* and
//!   its supporting evidence — "is what I just did actually correct and
//!   complete?" — not a linter and not a test runner.

Hunt specifically for: correctness bugs; requirements that are only partially met or silently \
dropped; unhandled edge cases (empty / huge / malformed input, concurrency and re-entrancy, \
error and failure paths, off-by-one, integer overflow, null/None); regressions in existing \
behaviour; and tests that pass but assert the wrong thing (green-CI-but-wrong). Prefer a small \

say so honestly rather than inventing problems.\n\
