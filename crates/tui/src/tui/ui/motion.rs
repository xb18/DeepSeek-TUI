/// terminal, which at 24 rows would hand the rail half the screen.
///
/// That floor moves. While the shell is fully idle the transcript is showing
/// the ocean, and the ocean does not draw at all below
/// [`AMBIENT_MIN_CHAT_HEIGHT`](crate::tui::underwater::AMBIENT_MIN_CHAT_HEIGHT)
/// rows — so on a 24-row terminal an always-on panel strip does not shrink
/// the water, it deletes it. Once there is real work on screen the floor
/// drops back to [`MIN_CHAT_HEIGHT`] and the rail gets its rows. Decorative
/// water yields to work; work never yields to decoration.
///
/// `idle_empty` alone is not enough to charge that floor. It is an
/// app-state predicate — it knows the session is quiet, not that the terminal
/// can draw. [`empty_state_mark_visible`](crate::tui::underwater::empty_state_mark_visible)
/// also demands
/// [`AMBIENT_MIN_CHAT_WIDTH`](crate::tui::underwater::AMBIENT_MIN_CHAT_WIDTH)
/// columns, so on a narrow terminal charging the ambient floor would reserve
/// 16 rows for a mark that cannot render at any height and make the strip
/// yield for nothing.
///
/// The row half of that gate is deliberately *not* mirrored here. It would be
/// a step down in terminal *height* — below the floor the rail would take the
/// rows, at the floor it would hand them back — and a strip that vanishes as
/// the terminal grows taller is the resize flicker this budget exists to
/// avoid. The swept axis must stay monotone.
///
/// The column gate is a real trade, not a free one, and an earlier version of
/// this comment wrongly claimed otherwise. Widening past
/// `AMBIENT_MIN_CHAT_WIDTH` on a short-but-tall terminal can swap a strip for
/// the ocean in one column step. That is accepted deliberately: a horizontal
/// resize past 60 columns is a deliberate act with a visible payoff (the
/// water appears), whereas the height version fires while dragging the axis
/// the strip is measured in. Both cannot be monotone at once — charging the
/// floor is what buys the whale its rows, and something has to give.
/// `rail_strip_and_whale_swap_at_the_ambient_width` pins the swap so it stays
/// a decision rather than drifting into an accident.
///
/// The composer is charged at a fixed floor rather than its measured height:
/// the real `composer_height` is itself computed from the strip height, and
/// feeding it back in here would close a loop that oscillates across a
/// resize instead of settling.
