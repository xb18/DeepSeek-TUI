//! The closed set of message roles Codewhale can put on a transcript.
//!
//! Roles used to be free-form `String`s on [`crate::request::Message`], and
//! four wire adapters each decided independently what an unfamiliar role
//! meant: two dropped it silently, one forwarded it verbatim for the provider
//! to reject, one failed closed. [`Role`] closes the set so that decision can
//! be made once, in one table, instead of four times by accident.
//!
//! Two properties are load-bearing and are covered by tests:
//!
//! * **Byte-identical serialization.** A `Role` serializes as exactly the
//!   string it replaced and deserializes from any string. Saved transcripts
//!   therefore need no schema bump and no migration ladder, and a session
//!   written by a newer build still loads here — an unfamiliar role lands in
//!   [`Role::Unrecognized`] rather than failing the whole session load.
//! * **`assistant_interrupted` stays distinct.** The interrupted-assistant
//!   sentinel is its own variant, not a flavour of [`Role::Assistant`], so it
//!   keeps round-tripping as a separate session item.
