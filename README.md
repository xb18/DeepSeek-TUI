# Codewhale

Codewhale is an open source coding agent for your terminal, built in Rust and
improved in public with the people who use it.

## Install

```bash
npm install -g codewhale
codewhale
```

The first run helps you connect a provider or stay offline. Codewhale also
supports Cargo, Docker, Nix, Scoop, prebuilt archives, Android/Termux, and a CNB
mirror. See [the installation guide](docs/INSTALL.md).

Tab completion is one command per shell — `codewhale completion bash|zsh|fish|powershell|elvish`.
See [shell completions](docs/INSTALL.md#8-shell-completions).

## Use

Talk to Codewhale the same way you would talk to a teammate:

```text
Fix the failing tests and explain what changed.
```

Or run a task without opening the TUI:

```bash
codewhale exec "fix the failing tests and explain what changed"
```

Codewhale can read your repository, edit files, run commands, inspect results,
and keep working toward a goal. You decide how much access it has.

## Why Codewhale

- **Use the model you want.** Connect hosted providers or local models through
  Ollama, vLLM, or SGLang. Switch provider and model with `/model`.
- **Stay in control.** Plan is read-only. Ask, Auto-Review, and Full Access make
  approval behavior visible. `/undo` reverts the last turn and `/restore`
  returns the workspace to an earlier snapshot.
- **Keep long work organized.** Save sessions, set a durable `/goal`, review
  workflows before they run, and coordinate agents without turning their
  internal instructions into your transcript.
- **Extend the agent you already have.** Connect MCP servers and skills,
  configure hooks, and keep agent roles as readable files in your project or
  personal settings.

Run `/help` in the TUI for commands and keyboard shortcuts.

## Safety

Codewhale runs on your machine with the access you grant it. Approval modes and
repository rules limit what the agent may do; optional OS sandboxing adds a
stronger execution boundary where supported. Unknown model prices stay unknown
instead of being reported as free.

Read [authorization order](docs/AUTHORIZATION_ORDER.md) for the exact policy
stack and [configuration](docs/CONFIGURATION.md) for local settings.

## Project history

Codewhale began as `deepseek-tui` and still preserves that configuration and
session compatibility. It is now provider-neutral and independently maintained;
it is not affiliated with any model provider.
