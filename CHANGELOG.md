## [Unreleased]

## [0.9.11] - 2026-08-21

Codewhale v0.9.11 tightens the long-running agent loop, makes workflow
failures visible instead of successful-looking, adds an experimental
vision-capable DeepSeek route, and prepares reproducible Codewhale-versus-Pi
evaluation without publishing a result before a real run. The complete
item-level change record is retained below the categorized release highlights.

### Added

- Added first-party `deepseek-v4-flash-vision-exp` discovery and selection for
  DeepSeek, including the `flash-vision` alias, bundled offline metadata,
  registry and picker entries, and image-input capability on the chat route.
  Context and output limits inherit from V4 Flash until DeepSeek publishes
  distinct values; pricing remains unknown rather than guessed.
- Added a provider-controlled Codewhale-versus-Pi parity harness with three
  hermetic coding tasks, route and reasoning-effort receipts, doctor/dry-run
  modes, and bounded result artifacts. The repository ships the harness, not a
  benchmark verdict; comparable real runs remain an acceptance gate.
- Added portable, secret-free config export/import with a reviewable plan,
  explicit headless consent, backup and rollback, and idempotent re-import.
- Added bounded multi-file diagnostics through the existing model-facing `lsp`
  tool without increasing the tool-catalog count. Thanks to **Isabel Wu
  ([@wuisabel-gif](https://github.com/wuisabel-gif))** for PR #5524.
- Added portable presentation, media-attachment, and operation-digest facets to
  the command contract, then moved all seven utility handlers onto the
  contract-backed dispatch path. Thanks to **Paulo Aboim Pinto
  ([@aboimpinto](https://github.com/aboimpinto))** for PR #5525.

### Changed

- Sub-agent, Fleet-worker, workflow-task, and thread-runtime model turns no
  longer inherit a hidden role-based step ceiling. An omitted or zero
  `max_steps` is unbounded; a positive user/config value remains an explicit
  cap and is still clamped to the runtime safety ceiling. Wall-clock, provider,
  heartbeat, cancellation, and admission safeguards are unchanged.
- `/rc` now mirrors one shared session rather than transferring terminal
  ownership: local and web prompts remain available while idle, approvals use
  first-decision-wins semantics, and transport/integrity failures remain
  fail-closed.
- The terminal status rows around the composer are now two stable bands:
  `provider · model · thinking level` is the persistent identity row below
  the composer in every phase, and a separate activity row above the
  composer carries the live phase, notices, and cost/metrics. Sending a
  prompt no longer relocates the route identity above the composer, and
  neither row ever duplicates it.
- The embedded local Web client now uses the current CWC Ocean hierarchy and
  readable control sizing, follows the shared Enter/Shift+Enter composer
  grammar, and chooses a provider plus model per new thread without mutating
  Runtime defaults. Exact image-input capability is labelled honestly; a
  vision-capable route does not imply that browser attachments exist.
- The runtime now has one authoritative model-turn loop. The placeholder
  `crates/core` engine tree is gone, while the active TUI loop and its extracted
  tool-call stages retain existing policy, hook, cancellation, and budget
  behavior. Thanks to **Sun Zhenyuan
  ([@bistack](https://github.com/bistack))** for PR #5523.

### Fixed

- Chat Completions streams now require terminal proof from `[DONE]` or a
  non-empty `finish_reason`. Protocol-only frames no longer count as answer
  content or time-to-first-token, and a provider continuation that ends after
  tool results with no answer or tool call fails durably instead of producing
  a false `Completed` receipt.
- A selected v2 Fleet now drives one bounded, deterministic Agent roster across
  terminal and runtime surfaces. Fleet operator/member/explicit-route
  precedence, resolved member identity, and exact `vision` requirement
  admission now fail visibly instead of silently falling back, first-matching,
  or rerouting.
- A workflow whose `task()` dispatch was rejected no longer loses that failure
  inside a `parallel()` null slot or presents a successful-looking run. Rejected
  dispatches now fail the run, persist as typed bounded receipts with an exact
  count, and appear in transcript, activity detail, and workflow-panel views.
- Provider readiness, credential-source explanations, focused-agent scrolling,
  compact `/status` and `/help` rendering, shell/web output bounds, MCP
  lifecycle reporting, and narrow-terminal onboarding received the detailed
  fixes recorded below.
- Localized READMEs again match the English install and third-party-notice
  surface, including shell-completion guidance in all 18 translations.

### Security

- Unified OAuth device-code polling now validates verification URLs before
  opening them, redacts token-bearing types, honors server slowdown intervals,
  and keeps credential save/logout mutations serialized.
- Project instructions, rules-directory traversal, secret-shaped config data,
  URL fingerprints, and shell network authority now retain the explicit bounds
  and fail-closed behavior described in the detailed record.

### Detailed change record

The notes below are preserved in full so the categorized highlights do not
erase behavior, migration, security, compatibility, or verification details.

- Provider completion is now evidence-based. A Chat Completions stream reaches
  `MessageStop` only after `[DONE]` or a non-empty `finish_reason`; raw EOF
  without either is a typed failure. Message-start, ping, usage/terminal
  deltas, block-stop, and message-stop frames do not count as productive
  content or mint time-to-first-token. After tool results, a terminal provider
  step with no answer or tool call now emits a durable failed turn and never
  fabricates an empty assistant message.

- A selected v2 Fleet is the single effective Agent roster across terminal,
  Runtime threads, direct Workflow, Fleet execution, doctor, and
  setup/readiness; legacy profile layers are consulted only when no Fleet is
  selected, and invalid selections fail visibly with bounded, redacted errors.
  Member references resolve exact id first and otherwise require a unique
  display name, role, pinned model, offline model name, or provider/model route;
  `agent action=roster` exposes that same bounded roster. The Fleet operator
  supplies fresh-root and inherited-member routing unless an explicit launch
  route or member pin wins, the resolved member is shown separately from the
  requested alias, and `requires = ["vision"]` is admitted only on an exact
  route with verified offline `image_input` support—never by silent rerouting
  or custom-proxy inference. Fleet selection remains an explicit user/folder
  contract independent of legacy project-profile loading.

- **Breaking (app-server):** `/prompt`, `prompt/request` and `prompt/run` now
  execute a real model turn instead of reporting success for work they never
  did. `Runtime::handle_prompt` called no model: it resolved config, ran a
  local `ModelRegistry` lookup, emitted three canned hook events
  (`ResponseDelta` was literally the string `model-selected`), and returned
  HTTP 200 with `output` set to a stringified JSON echo of the caller's own
  routing metadata — the prompt included. Worse, when a `thread_id` was
  supplied it appended a real user row, flipped the thread to `Running`, and
  then wrote that echo into durable history as an **assistant message** plus a
  `prompt_response` checkpoint. Nothing marked the row synthetic and nothing
  ever moved the thread out of `Running`. All three endpoints now route
  through the same `RuntimeBridge` that stdio `thread/message` has always
  used, so `output` is the model's streamed text, `model` is what the runtime
  reports for the thread that ran the turn, and `events` are the real
  streaming frames. `Runtime::handle_prompt` and its synthetic history write
  are gone.

- **Breaking (app-server):** a failed prompt is now a typed failure rather
  than a success-shaped body. `POST /prompt` returns
  `{"error":{"code":...,"message":...}}` with `400` (invalid request), `404`
  (thread not found), `503` (`runtime_unavailable`) or `500`, instead of HTTP
  500 carrying a `PromptResponse` with the error text stuffed into `output`
  where model text belongs. The stdio surface gained JSON-RPC `-32005`
  `runtime_unavailable` for "the turn engine could not be reached, so nothing
  ran" — distinct from `-32603`, and retryable. There is no configuration in
  which a prompt silently echoes instead of running.

- **Breaking (app-server):** `POST /thread` with a `Message` body runs the
  turn. It previously replied `status: "accepted"` with a
  `ResponseDelta("queued")` frame while starting no worker and calling no
  bridge — the stdio path for the same request has always done real work, so
  the two transports disagreed about what `accepted` meant. HTTP now replies
  `status: "completed"` once the turn reaches a terminal state, with the
  streamed frames in `events` and the turn id in `data`. `Runtime::handle_thread`
  no longer accepts `ThreadRequest::Message` at all: it owns thread
  bookkeeping, not the turn engine, and returns an error naming
  `POST /v1/threads/{id}/turns` rather than a canned acceptance.

- **Breaking (app-server):** `AppRequest::SubmitUserInput` now refuses
  explicitly (`ok: false`, `error: "user_input_reply_unsupported"`) instead of
  returning `resolved: true` and filing the answers in a map that had no
  reader anywhere in the crate — every answer submitted was silently
  discarded. It cannot be made to work on this transport: while a turn
  streams, the stdio loop executes only `thread/interrupt` and queues
  everything else, so an answer sent there would wait on the very turn
  waiting for it. The refusal names the surface that does accept it,
  `POST /v1/user-input/{thread_id}/{request_id}` on the runtime API. The
  `/tool` path that mints the `UserInputRequest` is unchanged and still
  genuine.
- Split the coordination ledger out of `tools/subagent/coord.rs` into
  `tools/subagent/coord/ledger.rs`. The file held two unrelated things: the
  model-facing `agents/*` tool wrappers, and the durable decision/claim/
  contention records those wrappers happen to write — records whose consumers
  are mostly *not* in the tool layer (`tui::coordination_detail`,
  `tui::work_surface`, `tui::ui::tests`, `core::engine::tests` all name these
  types). At 3.8k lines, reading either one started by scrolling past the
  other. A pure move with a glob re-export from `coord`, so every
  `crate::tools::subagent::coord::{…}` path still resolves and no consumer file
  was edited; the only content change the move required is one constant going
  from private to `pub(super)` because its caller stayed behind. `coord.rs` is
  now 2.3k lines and `ledger.rs` 1.6k.

- `agent` is now the only sub-agent tool the model can see. `AGENTS.md` has
  said "the model-facing sub-agent surface is `agent` only" since the lifecycle
  tools were removed, but six more were reachable: `agents/list`,
  `agents/message`, `agents/followup`, `agents/interrupt`, `agents/coordinate`,
  and `agents/wait` all defaulted to model-visible, so they shipped in the
  catalog and `tool_search` could load any of them — and the `agent`
  description told the model they existed. They now declare
  `model_visible() -> false`, the same shape `rlm` and `exec_shell` use: still
  registered, still executable by name so a persisted transcript replays
  against the same implementation, never advertised and never returned by
  either `tool_search` matcher.

  Five of the six were already duplicates of an `agent` action. The sixth was
  not: `agents/coordinate action=claim` was the *only* way to widen a write
  claim, and write enforcement fails closed, so hiding it would have left a
  refusal ("expand it first with…") pointing at a tool the model could no
  longer call. `agent` gains one action, `claim`, taking the write scope
  vocabulary `action=start` already uses (`write_roots`, plus parse-accepted
  `exact_files` and `coordination_contracts`). It keeps `agents/coordinate`'s
  `Auto` approval — gating it deadlocks autonomous fan-in — and it can only
  widen the caller's own scope; peer contention still fails. A scopeless claim
  is refused rather than reported as granted, because `expand_write_claim`
  returns the unchanged claim with `Ok` when every list is empty.

  Collapsing six tools into one action set also collapses the gating: `agent`
  is deliberately exempt from both name-keyed gates (`posture_permits_tool`
  short-circuits it so delegation depth governs spawning, and
  `execution_envelope` classifies it `Bounded` so a read-only member can fan
  out read-only work), so a capability folded into it inherits no gate. `claim`
  is therefore gated per action, reproducing the envelope check that kept
  `agents/coordinate` off a read-only role's catalog — in the catalog and again
  at dispatch, since catalog shaping is not an authority boundary. The other
  actions keep exactly the visibility they had.
- One placement table now decides which wire channel a message role belongs
  in, and unrepresentable role/dialect pairs are refused at the outbound seam
  (`DeepSeekClient::prepare_outbound_request`) instead of at the provider.
  Chat Completions and OpenAI Responses used to drop an unfamiliar role
  silently, Anthropic Messages forwarded `message.role` verbatim and took an
  opaque provider 400 for it, and Google cloud-code was alone in failing
  closed. Positioned `system` and `developer` history — including compaction
  and branch summaries — is carried natively by Chat Completions and Responses
  and projected, in place, onto Anthropic's user channel. It is neither
  hoisted nor dropped. Genuinely unknown roles keep the previous
  dialect-specific fail-closed/omit behavior, now decided in one table. The
  dead `"tool"` arm in the Responses adapter is gone — nothing constructs that
  role.

- Message roles are a closed `Role` enum (`crates/core/src/role.rs`) instead of
  a free-form `String` on `Message`. Four wire adapters each decided
  independently what an unfamiliar role meant, and a typo in a role string was
  a silent transcript edit rather than a compile error. `Role` keeps an
  `Unrecognized(String)` variant and serializes via `as_str()`, so a saved
  session's bytes are unchanged, a transcript written by a newer build still
  loads here, and `assistant_interrupted` stays a distinct session item — no
  session schema bump and no migration ladder.

- Portable config bundles: `codewhale config export --portable` writes a
  deterministic, secret-free bundle (credential and machine-specific keys
  dropped), and `codewhale config import <FILE|URL|->` applies one with a
  strict versioned envelope, a printed added/changed/skipped/conflicting/
  rejected plan, consent gating (`--yes` required headless), a timestamped
  backup with rollback, and idempotent re-import. Credential-shaped entries
  are rejected by key name and value shape — rejections name the field,
  never the value.

- `/rc` is now a shared-session mirror instead of a terminal takeover.
  Attaching the web app no longer locks the local composer or hides
  approvals: both surfaces can prompt while idle (one turn runs at a
  time), approval cards stay visible in the terminal and are shared with
  the web with first-decision-wins semantics (the losing side is told, a
  web decision dismisses the local card), and structured questions are
  answered locally instead of cancelled. Fail-closed behavior survives —
  the post-failure reconnect lockout, integrity-gated `/rc stop`, and the
  fail-closed shared-approval channel on transport loss are unchanged.
  The takeover vocabulary ("web owns prompts and approvals") is gone from
  every surface.

- Auto-mode provider readiness no longer reports "key saved · not checked"
  forever. Readiness checks are recorded against the concrete model the
  router ran, but auto-mode reads resolved against the literal `auto`
  identity, which never matched any recorded check — so the setup receipt,
  model picker, and fleet setup view showed an eternal unchecked badge
  even after hundreds of successful turns. The read now falls back to the
  most recent check on the same route (provider + endpoint + auth class);
  concrete-model reads keep exact per-model scoping.

- The focused sub-agent transcript now scrolls like the main transcript.
  The frame renderer sampled the ocean column through a `ChatWidget` whose
  constructor consumed `pending_scroll_delta` — every PageUp/PageDown and
  wheel event was swallowed by an invisible widget before the focused pane
  could read it. The delta is now parked across the sample; the pane pins
  on user scroll-up, follows new child activity at tail, and
  jump-to-bottom releases the pin.

- Every Codex OAuth Responses request carried `max_output_tokens`, a parameter
  that endpoint rejects outright ("Unsupported parameter: max_output_tokens"),
  so every gpt-5.6-sol turn — including every sub-agent on that route — failed
  at the first request. Codex Responses bodies now ship without a client-side
  output cap; the backend applies its own. Every other Responses route keeps
  the central cap on the wire, exactly as before.

- The model-facing `lsp` tool now supports a bounded `read_lints` operation
  for multi-file, workspace-relative LSP diagnostics without adding another
  tool catalog entry (#4070).

- HTTP 400 classification no longer calls an unsupported-parameter error a
  context-window overflow. Responses shape errors such as "Unsupported
  parameter: max_output_tokens" name a token-shaped field, which the generic
  keyword rules read as prompt-size exhaustion and pointed users at compaction
  that could never help. Such responses now classify as invalid requests.

- xAI device login validated nothing about the URL it opened. The
  `verification_uri` from the device-code response went straight to
  `webbrowser::open` with no parse, no scheme check and no credential check, so a
  spoofed or compromised issuer could hand the platform's "open this" call a
  `file:` path, a custom application scheme (`vscode://`, `slack://`), or a
  credential-bearing URL. The shared primitive now refuses anything that is not a
  web page before the URI is printed or opened. **Behaviour change:** a
  non-loopback plain-`http:` verification URI now aborts login where it
  previously opened; `http:` on a loopback host is still allowed, because local
  runtimes legitimately use it.
- The xAI OAuth types no longer print bearer material through `Debug`. Five types
  holding tokens (`GrokAuthEntry`, `TokenResponse`, `DeviceCodeResponse`,
  `DeviceCodeGrant` and the poll outcome) either redact or no longer derive
  `Debug` at all, so a token has no printable path through a `{:?}` on any
  surrounding struct. The shared `DevicePollOutcome` derives nothing, which the
  compiler enforces.
- **Behaviour change:** an `interval` of `0` from the authorization server now
  falls back to RFC 8628's five-second default rather than a one-second floor,
  in both the xAI and account device flows.

- OAuth device-code login is now one implementation. xAI/Grok device login and
  Codewhale account login each carried their own hand-rolled RFC 8628 polling
  loop with nothing shared between them; both now call a single primitive
  (`codewhale-config`'s `device_code`), ported from pi. Three fixes come with
  it. `slow_down` now honours a server-supplied `interval` instead of always
  adding five seconds, which is what stops polling from running early forever
  under WSL and VM clock drift. Timing out after a `slow_down` now says so and
  names clock drift, rather than reading as a plain timeout. And the xAI
  verification URI is validated before it is handed to the browser opener —
  Codewhale previously opened whatever the device-code response said, so a
  spoofed or compromised issuer could point the platform "open this" call at a
  `file:` path or a custom application scheme. It must now be `https:`, or
  `http:` on a loopback host for self-hosted issuers. Stored credential files
  are unchanged and existing logins keep working. MCP OAuth is untouched: it
  delegates to `rmcp`/`oauth2` and was never hand-rolled.
- Shell output truncation now stays inside its own budget. A truncated shell
  result keeps a 6 KB head, a 24 KB tail, and any high-signal lines rescued
  from the omitted middle — but that rescued block was bounded only by a line
  count. One rustc `error:` line carrying a long inferred type or a minified
  bundler frame is routinely hundreds of kilobytes, so a "30 KB" result could
  arrive at 430 KB with the omitted line pasted back in whole. Each rescued
  line is now clipped and the block has a 4 KiB ceiling; the signal survives,
  the payload does not.

- Fetched web pages in non-Latin scripts no longer arrive half-read. Page text
  was reflowed against a column budget measured in bytes, so Cyrillic and Greek
  wrapped at roughly half the intended width and CJK at two thirds — and since
  the page view is delivered by line count, the surplus lines pushed real
  content off the end of the window. A Russian or Japanese URL returned a
  fraction of the text an English one did, for the same call. Wrapping now
  measures display width.

- The `bash` tool no longer tells the model it has no default timeout when it
  does. An omitted timeout has always been bounded at 120 seconds and the
  command killed there, but the tool description and its `timeout` field both
  claimed otherwise — steering the model away from the one parameter that
  would have saved a longer build. Both now name the real bound.
- MCP servers no longer restart because an unrelated setting was saved. The
  lazy config reload re-reads every watched source whenever one of their
  mtimes moves and keeps the live connections only when the content hash
  matches — but the hash was taken over `serde_json` bytes produced straight
  from the config's `HashMap`s, and two `HashMap`s with identical contents do
  not iterate in the same order. Any touch of any watched file therefore hashed
  differently, tore down every connection, and SIGTERMed and respawned every
  stdio child. Keys are now sorted before hashing.

- An MCP server marked `required` now still tells you *why* it failed to start.
  `connect_all` appended a generic "required MCP server failed to initialize"
  entry after the real per-server error, and the snapshot folds those pairs into
  a map keyed by server name — so the contentless entry replaced the diagnosis
  and /mcp showed the marker instead of "No such file or directory". The marker
  is now only synthesized when nothing else reported a cause.

- A crashed stdio MCP server is now rebuilt instead of being handed back dead.
  A failed transport *read* disconnected the connection; a failed *write* did
  not, so after the child exited the connection stayed `Ready`, the pool reused
  it on every later tool call, and /mcp kept listing the server as connected.

- An MCP response carrying neither `result` nor `error` is now an error rather
  than an empty success. It previously reached the model as a successful tool
  call with a `null` payload, indistinguishable from a tool that did nothing.
  An explicit `"result": null` is still a valid empty success.
- `base_url_fingerprint` is a persisted-key change for two input shapes.
  The digest is serde-serialized into `ProviderCatalogCache` and
  `LiveOffering`, pricing defect receipts, and
  `TurnRecord.routed_usage_source_ids` — it is not an in-memory-only cache
  label. Empty or whitespace-only values (and scheme-less query-only strings
  that strip to an empty authority) now hash the invalid-or-secret-bearing
  sentinel instead of SHA-256 of the empty string. Scheme-less URLs that
  contain `@` now strip `userinfo` before hashing, matching the
  scheme-bearing branch, so a typed `user:pass@host/v1` no longer embeds the
  password in a stored digest. `routed_usage_source_fingerprint` feeds
  arbitrary scheme-less source ids into the same function, so a turn
  rehydrated from an older build can fail to dedupe one routed-usage row.
  Recovery is a cache miss and a re-fetch, not corruption. Empty input was
  not restored to the old digest: an empty authority is not a usable
  endpoint, and mapping it to the same sentinel the scheme branch already
  uses for an empty host keeps invalid inputs from minting a unique cache
  scope.

- Diagnostic lines that mention token *counts* are no longer swallowed by
  secret redaction. A stream error such as `max tokens = 8192 but budget =
  4096` was matching the `token` hint as a substring of the English word
  `tokens`, and the spaced-assignment pass then dropped the rest of the
  line, leaving `max tokens = [redacted]`. Token counts are not credentials;
  the hint now matches a credential identifier (`token`, `api_token`) rather
  than an English word, so the numbers survive while `token = Bearer …` is
  still redacted.
- Dashboard thread search no longer loads every thread's transcript to decide
  whether the row matches. `GET /v1/threads/summary?search=` walked the full
  thread list and called `get_thread_detail` on each row before matching, and
  that detail read is itself a whole-store walk of every turn JSON and every
  item JSON. A non-matching keystroke was therefore
  O(threads × (all_turns + all_items)) file reads — on the order of 10^8 JSON
  parses at a few thousand threads. Search now matches `id`, title, and model
  from the thread record (and, when the title is unset, the single latest-turn
  file that supplies the displayed title) and loads detail only for matches, so
  preview stays a display field rather than a search key. Session summary
  already refused to search last-message text for the same reason.

- Silent `#[allow(dead_code)]` suppressions on the modules AGENTS.md warns
  auditors not to delete — prompt zones, context budget, the route seam —
  and on the next-largest holders (palette tokens, hotbar actions, core
  events) are now `#[expect(dead_code)]`, or gone where the lint was already
  stale. A suppression that stops matching the lint fails the `-Dwarnings`
  gate instead of sitting quiet. The same gate is recorded in
  `[workspace.lints]` so member crates inherit it from the manifest rather
  than only from CI `RUSTFLAGS`.
- "missing key" now says where it looked. The provider picker reported
  credential readiness as the bare strings `missing key` / `key:not-set`,
  which named no source at all — so a home whose secret store held a working
  DeepSeek key could show `DeepSeek  missing key` in the picker while a real
  turn from that same home completed, and nothing on screen said which layer
  disagreed. Every row now resolves through one sourced resolver and states
  the place its credential came from ("OPENROUTER_API_KEY", `secret store
  "deepseek"`, `[providers.x] api_key`, "xAI OAuth", a consented external CLI
  file); a row without a credential lists the places that were probed, in
  precedence order, and the command that fixes the first of them. Where a
  durable slot is deliberately *not* read — an inactive provider whose config
  table carries no api-key marker — the row says so rather than implying an
  empty slot.

- Provider credential precedence is now stated once, in a doc comment beside
  the single resolver that enforces it, instead of being implied by a
  150-line cascade of provider special cases. No precedence decision changed:
  `has_api_key_for` is now a wrapper over that resolver, and a test asserts
  the two agree for every provider.

- Credential saves and logouts no longer interleave. Both took a snapshot of
  the durable slot, wrote it, mutated the config document, and rolled back on
  failure, with no lock held across the sequence — so a save racing a logout
  on the same slot could leave the secret store and the config file
  disagreeing. Both now hold that provider's credential write lock for the
  whole read-modify-write.

  Design ported from pi-mono (MIT, Copyright (c) 2025 Mario Zechner); see
  `docs/THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`.

- Enumerating stored credentials no longer fails closed on one bad slot.
  Listing used to propagate a backend read error, so a single unreadable
  secret-store entry made `/provider` and logout treat every other stored
  credential as missing. Enumeration now skips the unreadable slot and
  continues, matching the probe loop it replaced.

- The first screen of first run no longer cuts its own headline. The welcome
  and ready titles, and the provider-step heading, were emitted as single
  unwrapped lines while the sentence beneath them wrapped, so at 40 columns
  German read "Codewhale arbeitet mit dir in diesem O", Russian lost its final
  stop, and Japanese lost "します。". Headings are prose and now wrap like it,
  in every shipped locale.

- The workspace-trust screen no longer cuts its own question in half on a small
  terminal. The question, the prompt-injection risk hint, and the trust-effect
  hint were each pushed as one unwrapped line, so at 40 columns the screen read
  "Should Codewhale work with the instruc" — severed mid-word with nothing
  marking the cut, while the workspace path directly beneath it wrapped
  correctly. Asking someone to grant filesystem trust while the question itself
  is truncated is the worst place in the product for that to happen. All three
  now wrap through the same helper the rest of onboarding uses, which also
  means they wrap correctly in Japanese and Chinese. Verified across all
  fifteen shipped locales at 40, 60, 80 and 120 columns.
- `codewhale completions <shell>` generated a script for the wrong program.
  The subcommand forwarded to the in-tree `codewhale-tui` binary, which
  rendered completions from *its own* clap tree under *its own* name, so the
  output ended in `complete -F _codewhale__tui ... codewhale-tui` (bash),
  `#compdef codewhale-tui` (zsh), and
  `Register-ArgumentCompleter -Native -CommandName 'codewhale-tui'`
  (PowerShell). Sourcing it registered nothing for `codewhale` or `codew` —
  the two commands current installers expose — so tab completion appeared to
  do nothing. The forwarded tree was also stale against the real CLI: it offered
  `pr`, `scorecard`, and `session-diagnostics`, which `codewhale` does not
  have, and omitted `run`, `rc`, `config`, `model`, `thread`, `lane`,
  `workflow`, `web`, `account`, `app-server`, `mcp-server`, `metrics`,
  `update`, `cloud`, `completion`, and `lane-log-proxy`, which it does.
  Completions are now rendered in-process from the CLI's own command tree,
  and `completions` is an alias of the existing
  `completion` subcommand rather than a second, divergent path. Regenerate any
  script you installed from an earlier release. Reported by **RepentStar**
  (#5526); part of the `deepseek-tui`-era identifier retirement in #5443.

- Completion scripts now fire for the `codew` shorthand as well as
  `codewhale`. Releases publish `codew` as a byte-identical copy of the
  `codewhale` binary, so a script bound to only one of the two names was half
  installed for anyone who types the short one. Each shell gets its own
  idiomatic hook rather than a second copy of the script: bash re-binds the
  generated function, zsh widens the `#compdef` tag line to
  `#compdef codewhale codew`, fish adds `complete -c codew -w codewhale`,
  PowerShell registers `-CommandName 'codewhale','codew'`, and Elvish aliases
  the completer with
  `set edit:completion:arg-completer[codew] = $edit:completion:arg-completer[codewhale]`.

- Documented shell completions. `docs/INSTALL.md` § 8 now gives the generate
  and install commands for bash, zsh, fish, PowerShell, and Elvish, with a
  note to regenerate after upgrading and to delete scripts produced by
  v0.9.10 or earlier. There was previously no completion documentation
  anywhere in the repository, which is how #5526 was reported as three
  problems instead of one.
- `/status` was 31 rows. On an 80x24 terminal the transcript viewport is 18, so
  typing `/status` landed you on the *tail* of the report: the version, route,
  directory, mode and sandbox rows had already scrolled past, and what stayed on
  screen was five `not reported` rows and a `$0.0000`. The report is 18 rows on a
  fresh session — `Window override:` is present unless the value is already
  configured. That is the viewport's height, so once `/status` itself occupies a
  history cell the title row still scrolls off; it does not fit that terminal
  whole. Provider, model and reasoning effort are one `Route:` lockup, the way
  the header rail already writes them. Mode and its permissions are one statement
  of posture. `Rate limits:` is gone — it was a `push_row` of a string literal
  and could never say anything but "not available from provider telemetry". The
  per-turn token ledger is gone too, because `/tokens` is that ledger's whole
  subject and `/status` was printing six rows of it at the same weight as the
  sandbox policy; the two facts that lived nowhere else, the cumulative in/out
  split and the cumulative cache totals, survive on one `Session tokens:` row.
  `Footer items:` no longer prints ten internal config keys across the full
  width — `/statusline` owns them, and the report now points there in the same
  row that points at `/tokens`. Two blank gutters do the grouping; the
  `===================` rule under the title is gone.

- The `/status` window-override key has its own labelled row. It used to be
  parenthesised onto the end of the provenance row, which pushed
  `context_window in config.toml` past the right edge at 80 columns and wrapped
  the sentence. `Window source:` states the provenance and `Window override:`
  names the exact key — and the override row is omitted entirely when the value
  is already configured, rather than advising you to set what you have set.

- `/help` no longer truncates anything. Every label and description used to run
  through a `truncate_to_width` that appended `…`, which in a two-hundred-row
  list promises text no keystroke can reveal and lands mid-token:
  `(aliases: /qin…` left the parenthesis hanging open. Descriptions now shed
  whole fields — the alias parenthetical first, then trailing clauses at their
  own joints, and only where there is no joint at all, the sentence's short form
  on a whole word with no mark, keeping the head noun of a simple verb +
  modifier + noun phrase rather than the adjectives that qualified it. The
  focused row's description is restated under the filter at the panel's full
  width, *only when the row itself could not hold it*, so a wide terminal does
  not say the same sentence twice. At 60 columns that restatement is itself
  shed — the `/advisor` detail stops before `session` — so the detail is longer
  than the row, not a copy of the original sentence.

- The `/help` label column is measured instead of assumed. It was a flat 28
  columns at every terminal size, so at 60 columns twenty blank cells sat
  between `/advisor` and a description cut down to 21. Each group now sizes its
  column to the labels it actually holds, which nearly doubles the description
  column on a narrow terminal, and the label — the string you have to type —
  reads one step brighter than the description that qualifies it.

- `/help` stopped spending rows on itself. The match count moved onto the filter
  row it describes, the blank spacer under it is gone, and the footer no longer
  repeats `type to filter` while the filter box says `Type to filter` two lines
  above — at 60 columns that duplicate was what pushed the footer onto a second
  row. A group header also stopped printing `▸ ▾`: the selection cursor and the
  collapsed chevron are the same glyph, and a focused collapsed group was
  showing it twice for two different facts. Help now opens focused on the first
  entry rather than the header above it.

- The bottom status rail is no longer one run-on sentence. At 120 columns it
  read `▌· idle · Ollama · deepseek-v4-flash · max · Anonymous usage counts are
  on. … ⌥V:output · /context:context · fn+F1:keys` — live state, route
  identity, a telemetry consent notice, and keyboard hints all strung together
  by the same middle dot in the same ink, so nothing was grouped and the eye
  had nothing to skim by. At 80 columns it simply stopped mid-notice, and at 60
  the row overflowed and was clipped by the terminal mid-word. The rail now
  divides its groups with a blank gutter instead of another dot (the dot is
  kept for peers *inside* a group), the model name reads one step brighter than
  the qualifiers that narrow it, and `Esc to interrupt` reads in the same hint
  weight as the right-hand chords rather than in the separator weight.

- Nothing on the status rail is ever truncated now. A notice sheds whole
  sentences to fit, and if one sentence is still too long it sheds at the inner
  joints — a colon, a semicolon — with the trailing mark cut so the phrase that
  survives does not itself advertise that more was coming. Route identity sheds
  the provider, then the reasoning effort, rather than rendering
  `deepseek-v4-flash-prev…`; a clipped model name is worse than no model name
  because routes share prefixes. Clauses rejoin without a Latin space after a
  full-width stop, so the Japanese receipt reads as Japanese.

- A notice now stands the standing facts down instead of queueing behind them.
  Route identity and the ledger chips are still there in ten seconds; the
  notice is not, so it takes the row and the key hints yield last. This is what
  makes the telemetry receipt readable at 80 columns, where it used to be
  simultaneously always present and never legible.

- The status rail no longer advertises `/context:context`. It was spending
  eighteen columns of a 24-row screen to name a slash command that announces
  itself the moment you type `/`; the rail advertises chords you cannot
  discover any other way. The rail now reads the same at 80 columns as at 200.

- The idle screen no longer has an absolute path stretched across it. The
  workspace caption between the wordmark and "What do you want to accomplish?"
  was composed at full length and then truncated to the lane width, which made
  the centering inset `(width - caption.width()) / 2` evaluate to zero — so a
  line that was written to be centered rendered flush-left and full-bleed,
  cutting the centered whale/wordmark/prompt composition in half. The clipping
  also destroyed the information it was supposed to carry: at 80 columns the
  line read `/private/tmp/claude-501/-Volumes-.../34267917-11f4-4d15-911a-…`,
  which tells the reader nothing about where they are. The caption now sheds
  detail instead of being cut — MCP count first, then branch, then leading path
  components — so it always fits with room to center, and the folder you are
  standing in is the last thing to go. Elisions land on a path separator rather
  than mid-directory.

- Removed the placeholder engine tree in `crates/core/src/engine/`. Its
  `Engine::run` accepted `Op::SendMessage`, appended to a journal, and emitted
  `TurnComplete { status: "completed" }` without ever contacting a model, and
  `TurnExecutor` was a struct with a field-copy constructor and a
  `step < max_steps` comparison. Nothing in the workspace referenced any of it —
  the only mention of `codewhale_core::engine` anywhere was a doc comment inside
  the tree itself — but its comments ("the real turn loop is wired here in the
  next slice") were what `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` leaned on to claim that
  `crates/core` owns the agent loop. There is now exactly one turn loop in the
  workspace, `Engine::run_turn`, and a guard test fails if a second one appears.
  `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` and `AGENTS.md` now say where it actually lives.

- First-run onboarding no longer silently truncates its explanation in
  languages that do not put spaces between words. `wrap_words` split on
  whitespace, so a Japanese sentence arrived as a single token, the
  line-break check (which only fires once a line is non-empty) never
  triggered, and the over-wide line was clipped by the terminal. At 80
  columns the provider screen read
  "Hosted providers need a key, but loca" and stopped — losing exactly the
  half that tells the reader local runtimes need no key, on the screen where
  they choose a provider. Space-less scripts now break by display width on
  grapheme clusters, and a line may not begin with closing punctuation
  (`。`, `、`, `」`, `）` and friends). Wrapping for languages that do use
  spaces is unchanged.

- Project instructions are bounded by one budget and no longer treat other
  agents' files as law by default. Previously `.claude/instructions.md` and
  `CLAUDE.md` sat at ranks 2 and 3 of the canonical instruction list — *above*
  Codewhale's own `.codewhale/instructions.md` — `.claude/rules/` was an
  auto-discovered rules directory, and `.cursorrules`, `.cursor/rules`,
  `.clinerules`, `.windsurf/rules`, `.gemini`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
  and `.github/muse-instructions.md` were all imported into the system prompt
  with no opt-in. Dropping a `CLAUDE.md` written for a different tool into a
  repository silently made it standing authority here, which is an injection
  surface rather than a convenience. Codewhale now reads `AGENTS.md`, the
  cross-agent `.agents/AGENTS.md`, and its own instruction files by default;
  every other agent's format is opt-in by name through
  `project_instruction_imports` (env `CODEWHALE_PROJECT_INSTRUCTION_IMPORTS`),
  imported files rank *below* Codewhale's own, and a workspace that contains an
  un-imported format says so in a warning naming the exact setting.
- Separately, a symlinked candidate rules directory — `.cursor/rules`,
  `.windsurf/rules`, or `.gemini` pointing outside the workspace — was
  traversed and its contents imported as instruction authority, because the
  directory check followed the link while only the files inside it were
  checked. The two instruction loaders now apply the same no-follow rule that
  `.codewhale/rules/` already had.
- The three separate ceilings on standing instructions (200 KiB for the
  root->workspace chain, 500 KiB for the rules block, 40 KiB for imported
  fragments, and a global layer that was merged in after the chain budget had
  already closed and so counted against nothing) are replaced by a single
  48 KiB aggregate budget covering all of them together. Instructions claim it
  before rules, and are trimmed from the broadest scope inward so the
  nearest-scope file is the last thing dropped rather than the first thing
  stranded. Truncation still leaves an explicit marker.

- Editing the workspace no longer grants the shell outbound network access.
  `workspace-write` sandboxes are created network-restricted; `curl`, package
  installs, and `git fetch` inside a sandboxed shell are denied by the OS
  sandbox unless network is granted explicitly. This closes a real gap rather
  than tightening a working boundary: the elevation added in #273 was justified
  by the application-level `NetworkPolicy` remaining "the only outbound
  boundary", but that policy governs `fetch_url`, `web_search`, and MCP HTTP
  and never constrained shell subprocesses, so workspace-write turns had
  unrestricted egress with nothing enforcing anything. Network now comes from
  one of three explicit places: the new `sandbox_network_access` config key
  (also `CODEWHALE_SANDBOX_NETWORK_ACCESS`), a `danger-full-access` posture, or
  the existing post-denial elevation prompt that grants network for a single
  call. Yolo and `--yolo`/Bypass are unchanged — they resolve to
  `danger-full-access`, which applies no sandbox at all. `external-sandbox`
  reports the network it was actually granted instead of hardcoding `true`, and
  `/status` reads the flag instead of printing "network on" for every
  workspace-write policy. Platforms with no sandbox backend (default Linux
  without bubblewrap, and Windows) still enforce nothing, and both `/status`
  and `doctor` continue to say so.

- The nightly Windows ARM64 artifact build works again. Every nightly from
  2026-08-16 failed while compiling `codewhale-tui`, deterministically on the
  same codegen unit across all three build attempts, with
  `thread 'optimize module codewhale_tui...-cgu.13' has overflowed its stack`.
  The trigger is stack depth in the LLVM worker threads that run per-codegen-unit
  optimization, not the workflow's `lto=off` override: holding the crate and
  every flag fixed and varying only `RUST_MIN_STACK` on aarch64 shows 1 MiB
  crashes rustc while 2 MiB and 4 MiB succeed. Unix std defaults to 2 MiB and
  passed; the Windows ARM64 runner sat under the requirement. Nightly now sets
  `RUST_MIN_STACK` explicitly for every target, because the requirement follows
  from the size of `crates/tui` rather than from the platform. The redundant
  `codegen-units` override is gone -- `[profile.release]` already sets 16, so
  restating it never changed anything. Shipped binaries were never affected;
  `release-artifacts.yml` builds `--profile dist` with fat LTO and
  `codegen-units = 1`.

- Test debt: the transcript history-cell suite has been rebuilt. It was 123
  tests across 3,964 lines, and about a third of it pinned the current skin
  rather than any behavior -- `assert_eq!(spans[1], "⣤")` for the
  reduced-motion marker, `title_span.style.fg == theme.tool_title_color`,
  `visible[1] == "▏ done: scan repo"`, four separate tests each asserting one
  shape of fenced code never takes the transcript rail, and one test whose
  only assertion was `!text.is_empty()` under a name promising it checked the
  rendered tool id. Assertions like those break on every legitimate visual
  change and catch nothing a reader of the transcript would notice, which is
  the liability `d64b9429b` named. The replacement is 40 tests, each named
  for the property it protects and asserting the property instead of the
  token: reduced motion is checked by rendering the same running card at two
  different elapsed times and requiring the frames to match -- which also
  catches an animation leak the glyph constant missed -- and a frozen marker
  must stay visible rather than landing on the spinner's invisible blank
  (U+2800). Severity colors are checked by requiring warning not to read as
  error rather than by naming a palette entry. A streaming assistant glyph
  must actually pulse when motion is allowed, checked against
  `pulse_brightness` rather than by sleeping on the 2s sine. Each of the
  invariants claimed was verified to fail the new suite when deliberately
  broken in the renderer.
## [0.9.10] - 2026-08-19

- Show the full slash-command or `/model` completion row in a bounded, wrapping hover popover whenever narrow terminals truncate it, closing the remaining scoped gap from [#998](https://github.com/Hmbown/CodeWhale/issues/998). Thanks [@AiurArtanis](https://github.com/AiurArtanis) and [@formp3](https://github.com/formp3) for identifying the affected surfaces.
- `registry_sync` no longer ships the full MCP Registry catalog into the
  conversation. It takes a required query, scores the local snapshot
  host-side, and returns at most eight matches; the complete catalog stays on
  disk, and the compaction and spillover exemptions that let a multi-hundred-
  kilobyte dump reach the model unchanged are gone.
- Providers that mirror the outgoing `(reasoning omitted)` replay placeholder
  back as a reasoning delta no longer have that echo ingested as real
  thinking: the exact transport placeholder is dropped on arrival, so live
  sessions stop showing a stream of placeholder reasoning blocks and saved
  transcripts stay free of them.
- Mid-stream connection drops during an interactive turn no longer persist a
  synthetic `[runtime]` user message. Retry state is a typed engine-internal
  descriptor; a thinking-only drop re-issues the request without claiming a
  partial reply was preserved, the retry budget is enforced in mechanism, and
  recovery produces exactly one authoritative final answer.

Codewhale v0.9.10 is a retention, identity, and product-clarity release: the shell and
transcript can no longer retain unbounded tool output in memory or on disk,
mid-turn history inserts no longer strand in-flight tool rows, every agent
that ran this session is visible from `/agents list`, the PTY acceptance
lane has a stall watchdog and bounded CI steps, approval outcomes are
durable and fail closed (cyq1017, #5360), and three $HOME disk leaks are
reclaimed. Extension surfaces now name their real state and act only
through the reviewed install and trust flows, and sub-agent, shell, task,
and workflow state is owned by the session that created it (#5518). Test
threads get an 8 MiB stack so the lib suite can no longer
abort under load.

### Fixed

- First run starts on the welcome screen again. A missing key no longer
  skips Welcome and auto-opens the local-provider list: Enter walks to the
  calm provider explanation, then Enter opens the picker so a first API key
  can be set. Returning missing-key recovery still opens the picker on
  launch.
- A foreground `bash` command that named no timeout is bounded again. The
  model-facing `bash` tool left an omitted `timeout_ms` at the internal
  ceiling (~24.8 days) instead of the 120 s default its own schema
  advertises, so a CLI that blocked on an interactive prompt or a hung
  network call held the turn open indefinitely — one report sat on a single
  unauthenticated CLI call for over two hours with the tool row simply
  counting seconds. The advertised default now applies, which arms the
  existing recovery: the process is killed and the model is told to rerun
  with `background=true` and poll with `action="wait"`. An explicit
  `timeout_ms` is still honored for genuinely long foreground work, and
  background and interactive runs keep their own lifetimes.
- The Extensions (`/plugin`) Marketplace is no longer a read-only list.
  Every recommendation and stored candidate names its truthful state and
  primary action — Add, Enable, Configured, or Unavailable — and Enter or a
  mouse click runs that action through the existing reviewed `/mcp add
  recommended`, `/mcp enable`, and `/plugin` install/trust controllers, so
  no second trust path exists. Browser Use and Sandbox Runtime stay
  honestly Unavailable with their real setup routing instead of implying an
  install Codewhale cannot perform.
- The Extensions MCP tab now renders one honest inventory: the header count
  and the visible rows derive from the same configured-server set, so
  `MCP (6)` can no longer sit above two rendered rows. Disabled servers
  stay visible and labeled disabled instead of silently disappearing, and
  configured servers absent from the live snapshot list as not-yet-inspected
  with their own explicit reload affordance through the MCP command
  controller.
- Installed plugin rows now act on their real state: Enter opens an active
  bundle (`/plugin show`), offers Enable for a trusted-but-disabled bundle,
  or routes an untrusted bundle to the existing trust review — through the
  same confirmation and persistence controllers as the slash commands.
- Sub-agent handoffs and rosters, background shell jobs, durable tasks,
  delayed continuations, and workflow controls are now scoped to the
  session that owns them. Records carry immutable root-session ownership,
  stale completion-channel payloads are rejected before deduplication,
  background work drains and reports only to its owning session, and
  legacy ownerless jobs fail closed (#5518 failure class reported by
  @hxfhd; the report's exact JavaScript provenance was not claimed as
  reproduced).
- The resolved route envelope now reaches every outbound model call: all
  wire dialects and auxiliary calls clamp at the shared transport seam
  under one wire/reservation budget, provider input limits are honored, and
  switching models on the same protocol no longer inherits the previous
  model's limits (#5516, #5518).
- First-run continuity: the chosen onboarding provider persists across
  restarts, a missing first-run config no longer interrupts the flow, and
  the automatic working-agreement checkpoint renders as a standalone setup
  handoff instead of regressing the onboarding rail to the full wizard's
  4/10 progress.
- Explicitly worded natural-language `/goal` declarations now create a
  durable goal in the provider-neutral engine before model dispatch, while
  ordinary tasks and quoted transcripts stay out of goal mode and prose
  acknowledgement alone can no longer stand in for goal creation.
- `/model` now keeps the current Z.ai default (`GLM-5.3`) visible when an
  older installation has an explicit `GLM-5.2` route saved. The saved 5.2
  route remains exact; choosing 5.3 sends and remembers the distinct 5.3 ID.
- The constitution checkpoint now leads with the bundled balanced agreement;
  the default path writes no custom constitution. The startup launch surface
  distinguishes read-only Chat from folder-bound, approval-gated Work.
- Tabby and other IME bridges no longer observe a stale visible caret while a
  frame diff is being painted; Codewhale hides the cursor during the diff,
  restores the canonical composer cell, and only then reveals it again
  (BrathonBai, #5023).
- Pre-header HTTP/2/SSE transport failures get one bounded HTTP/1.1 retry;
  authentication, provider-semantic, response-body, and already-pinned HTTP/1
  failures remain fail-closed (demian-welt, #4683).
- MCP `tools/call` images now travel as bounded typed content instead of
  leaking base64 through model-visible JSON. Direct and parallel calls share
  the same MIME, size, validation, and one-image boundary (PR #5515 by
  @cacdcaecawae).
- Linux npm installs and updates race GitHub Releases against the CNB mirror
  at the checksum-manifest layer, then download from the first verified source
  without making users wait through a doomed slow-source timeout.
- `CODEWHALE_PREFER_BWRAP` now applies the documented Linux sandbox override,
  and Codewhale-era names own build metadata, hook session/tool-call IDs, and
  sandbox child markers. The corresponding `DEEPSEEK_*` names remain as 0.9.x
  compatibility aliases (#5443).
- Windows default launch prefers Windows Terminal: zip archives ship
  `codewhale.bat` (CRLF, `wt.exe` then the exe), `install.bat` copies that
  launcher, and the NSIS Start Menu shortcut opens it instead of the raw
  binary (#1854).
- `fix(tui): make the header status mark honour its setting` — `status_indicator`
  did nothing for three of its four documented values. The header hardcoded a
  leading `cw` span *and* asked for a second mark beside the effort chip, then
  filtered the second one against the literal `"cw"`; because `cw`, the legacy
  `whale` opt-in, and every unknown value all normalize onto that same mark,
  the filter discarded them and left `off` with nothing to turn off. `cw`,
  `whale`, `off`, and a typo all rendered byte-identical headers. There is one
  mark now and the setting owns it: `cw`/`whale` draw the typographic mark,
  `dots` draws the activity frames, `off` removes it (thejayjetson, #5512).
- `fix(tui): rebase active-cell tool bindings on every mid-turn history
  insert` — `/rename` mid-turn left the running tool row spinning forever
  (#5478).
- `fix(tui): bound what the shell and transcript retain from tool output` —
  a 1.1 MB Bash call kept over a megabyte resident for up to an hour; raw
  streams now cap at 16 MiB in flight and release delivered output, and
  retained tool outputs cap at 64 KiB per record / 8 MiB per transcript
  (#5472).
- `fix(tui): reclaim the three $HOME disk leaks` — orphaned session dirs,
  the unbounded audit.log, and stranded writer temp files.
- `fix(tui): persist approval outcomes before execution` (cyq1017) —
  approval receipts are committed to a session-owned log before execution
  proceeds; unpersistable evidence blocks the tool; resume reconstructs
  closed and interrupted approvals (#5360).
- `test(tui): break the LazyLock/env-barrier deadlock in the test harness`.
- `ci: give test threads the 8 MiB stack they need` — the lib suite aborted
  with SIGABRT under load on the default 2 MiB stack.
- YOLO entry points honor a locked approval policy: `--yolo`, `/mode yolo`,
  `/zidong`, and Alt+Y can no longer set Full Access + trust + shell when
  config or managed requirements own the posture.
- Terminal PTY tools fail closed without a sandbox backend under a narrowed
  filesystem posture, and otherwise start `$SHELL -i` through
  `SandboxManager::prepare` like `bash`.
- Skill update refuses to replace a directory that has no `.installed-from`
  marker — same ownership gate plugins already used.
- `cp`/`mv` are workspace-safe only when every path operand stays inside
  the workspace — Auto-Review no longer auto-allows `cp /etc/passwd .`.
- Main CI no longer shares one concurrency group per branch: each SHA
  gets a verdict instead of a cancelled pending run. A hermetic Safety
  gate job runs authorization tests in under 15 minutes (test bankruptcy
  restructuring — no tests deleted).
- Config-fixture tests no longer honor `lock_test_env` as a license to
  read a populated `~/.codewhale/config.toml`; they need an `EnvVarGuard`
  like settings already did. Safety-gate and CNB workspace tests pin a
  hermetic `CODEWHALE_HOME`. `exec_persistent_service` is serialized in
  nextest and inside the cargo-test binary instead of dropped (#5355).
- Short CLI no longer waits up to three seconds for a telemetry POST on
  exit; `session_end` is recorded and the buffer ships on the next
  interactive session.
- Bare `/` now opens a deliberately small starter set: `/help`, `/setup`,
  `/model`, `/settings`, `/resume`, and `/rc`. The full command inventory
  remains searchable through `/help`, the command palette, and direct prefix
  typing, without front-loading the entire control surface (#5442, #5439).
- First run now asks only for decisions needed to become usable, keeps the
  offline route explicit, and leaves optional provider, tools, policy, and
  appearance work in the progressive `/setup` repair guide. The idle aquarium
  asks one task-oriented question instead of advertising a tutorial or command
  billboard, and the localized telemetry choice appears after the workspace is
  ready without blocking the composer.
- Provider, active model, and reasoning effort moved out of the crowded header
  into a quiet, width-aware footer identity. Compact layouts keep model and
  effort before provider detail and shed whole low-priority groups instead of
  clipping the composer or control hints.
- The model picker no longer re-parses `~/.codewhale/config.toml` once per
  provider when deciding who has a saved key.

### Added

- `/workflows` opens a live run dashboard over this workspace's durable
  workflow journal: every retained run with status, phases, child roster,
  progress, and host-side cancel — observation only, it never launches a run.
- Repository instructions now assemble from the actual containing checkout:
  applicable `AGENTS.md` files resolve repository-root to current-directory in
  order under one aggregate budget, a linked worktree is its own root, and
  scope is never inferred from path mentions or whichever branch is named
  `main`.
- `/goal` is a codex-style control plane: setting an objective dispatches it
  to the engine, which owns the goal and starts the first goal turn itself —
  the objective is never echoed back as the user's own message, pause/resume
  are real control ops, and the hunt-era vocabulary and trophy cards are
  gone.
- `/extensions` and `/plugins` open one localized inventory for Hooks,
  Plugins, local Marketplace catalogs, Skills, and MCP. Reviewed suggestions
  include Playwright, Chrome DevTools, Cua Computer Use, Browser Use, and the
  sandbox runtime without granting trust or installing anything on open.
- Turn Inspector now opens the newest turn and pages across complete recorded
  user, reasoning, tool/subagent, and assistant output with page-scoped search,
  copy, and export (sky-sun-moon, #1682).
- Background tasks have bounded incremental persistence, durable terminal
  reasons, truthful timeout/cancellation receipts, restart recovery, and
  interruptible continuous-goal delays (#5497, #5508).
- `/title` once again controls the terminal window title independently from
  `/rename`, survives session save/load, and sanitizes control, bidi, and
  zero-width characters (PR #5509 by @SparkofSpike).
- MCP snapshots preserve whether capabilities were advertised by the server,
  discovered through the bounded legacy fallback, or not observed (#4170).
- `codewhale auth status --diagnostic` reports canonical paths, isolation
  source, backend class, and value-free provider-source presence without
  opening credential stores or creating/migrating state (#2369).
- `codewhale doctor --probe-search` performs an explicit credential-free,
  policy-checked transport probe for the selected search provider; ordinary
  doctor and JSON output remain offline (#5442).
- The safe deferred `read_media` tool is available to supported read-only
  roles, and history receipts distinguish localized tool execution outcomes
  without exposing raw payloads (#5102).
- **npm Linux x64 first-party source selection.** The wrapper concurrently
  fetches the GitHub Releases and CNB checksum manifests for the exact
  package version, locks the first source whose HTTP response and manifest
  validate, and downloads binaries only from that source. Explicit
  `CODEWHALE_RELEASE_BASE_URL` / `CODEWHALE_USE_CNB_MIRROR=1` still skip the
  race; other targets stay on GitHub.
- `/workflow <objective>` and `/workflow run <path>` now produce a bounded,
  tool-less proposal for review. Only `/workflow confirm` can launch that
  reviewed draft; status, cancel, settings, and the `/workflows` dashboard stay
  host-owned and do not spend a model turn (#5439).
- `feat(tui): add cancellable cadence to continuous goals` (M-Maciej) —
  `[goal] continuation_delay_seconds` gives coordinator goals a visible quiet
  period between successful turns while reusing the existing coalesced goal
  continuation token; Esc, Ctrl+C, pause/done/blocked/clear cancel before the
  next provider request, and failures never continue (#5508).
- `feat(tui): add command context adapters and migration gate (FEAT-015)`
  (aboimpinto) — TUI-owned capability facets, a dual-path dispatch seam, and
  source-aware CI enforcement so a command slice cannot claim to be migrated
  while it still accepts concrete `App`. Zero production commands migrate in
  this slice (#5316).
- `feat(web): move docs/hooks and docs/troubleshooting onto the dictionary
  spine` (Lstarsky0) — both pages now read copy from the locale dictionaries
  instead of inline bilingual literals (#5337).
- `feat(web): move docs/constitution and docs/runtime-api onto the dictionary
  spine` (Lstarsky0) — both pages now read copy from the locale dictionaries
  instead of inline bilingual literals; another incremental phase of #5337,
  not completion of the full epic (#5517).
- `docs(i18n): complete Tier 1 of Chinese docs localization` (SparkofSpike) —
  Chinese and Indonesian docs move to `docs/zh_hans/` and `docs/id/`, with
  redirect stubs at the old paths for one release cycle (#5482).
- `feat(tui): show repository context in git chrome` (wuisabel-gif) — the TUI
  header now identifies the active repository or linked worktree before the
  branch and dirty marker, so operators can see where the agent is working
  without opening the worktree manager (#5437).
- `feat(tui): formalize the status-bar color grammar` — seven semantic
  families live in `docs/design/STATUS_BAR_COLOR_GRAMMAR.md` and
  `palette::grammar`; header and phase-strip ink resolve through named
  `ChromeInk` slots so chrome cannot invent an eighth meaning or spend
  Failure red on a dirty worktree or selected mode. The footer's session
  metrics strip resolves through the same inks, and the red reservation is
  checked against every selectable theme, not just the whale default;
  typed footer toasts resolve through the grammar too.
  Repo/worktree chrome stays metadata and still renders when Git names a
  location but not a ref (#5437).
- `feat(tui): first slice of the agents roster` — every agent that ran this
  session, receipts-only, via `/agents list` and the sidebar fan-out rows
  (#5479 spec items 1 and 5).
- `ci: bound PTY acceptance and add a stall watchdog to the harness` —
  QA_PTY_STALL_TIMEOUT_SECS aborts a wedged PTY run with a diagnostic;
  the isolated PTY step is capped at 15 minutes; Windows NSIS provisioning
  gets a bounded retry (#5496).
- `chore(scripts): dev-cache warns before it fills a disk` (#5465 class).

## [0.9.9] - 2026-08-18

Codewhale v0.9.9 is a truth-and-resilience release: the shell tool can no
longer wedge a session when the host runs out of disk or descriptors,
unverified context windows and output ceilings are labeled honestly at every
surface, DeepSeek V4 is priced on the published peak/off-peak tiers, SSE
UTF-8 fails closed in every dialect, Fleet shadowing is visible, bwrap gets
container essentials and extra roots, the `dsh` skin rides the bundle
profile, the `agent` tool schema is down to 12 fields, and README/website
locales grow to 18 and 8.

### Fixed

- The lowercase `bash` tool no longer wedges when its complete-output spill
  file cannot be created: a full temp volume or exhausted descriptor table
  used to fail *every* call — `echo ok` included — with the harness-internal
  "Failed to create streaming shell output" and never recover until the
  host was cleaned up. The spill is now best-effort (the bounded tail is
  still returned and the truncation notice says why the full-output path is
  missing), and any remaining spawn/stream failure names the exhausted
  resource — disk, file descriptors, memory — and says the next call is safe
  to retry (#5465; the wedge that took out the owner's own 0.9.9 session).
- A concrete route/offering output limit now outranks the conservative
  8,192-token compatibility guess for an uncatalogued model. Routes that
  publish no output limit remain fail-closed, documented model ceilings stay
  authoritative, and a route limit can never raise the requested cap (#5460).
- Context-window honesty at every surface (#5239, #5441): the
  `model-name hint` and `fallback` rungs of the context-window ladder are
  guesses, and every surface that renders one now says so — the status line,
  `/status`, `/config`, the context-pressure message, the model picker chips,
  and the auto-router inventory. Unverified windows still drive real budgets
  (compaction trigger, context meter, output reservation); they just stop
  reading as capabilities anyone checked. A window parsed from an `_Nk`
  model-name suffix (`qwen3-32b-256k` → 256K) is now its own
  `model-name hint` rung below `catalog`, because it is optimistic rather
  than conservative — a catalog or provider-reported value beats it. The
  `[providers.<name>] context_window` override remains the hard fix and
  renders as `configured` with no marker.
- Output-ceiling honesty (#5440): an Anthropic-family model the catalog does
  not describe keeps the 64K Messages floor as its clamp and the ChatGPT/
  Codex OAuth route keeps its 4K policy, but `OutputCeilingSource` gained an
  `unverified` rung for both, so exec-stream receipts and the model picker
  label them `unverified`/"assumed floor" instead of `documented`. Clamp
  values are unchanged.
- Telemetry default-on is visible (#5441): `codewhale doctor`'s
  runtime-posture section gained a `telemetry=on (default)`-style row with
  the source that decided it (cli | env | config | default), and
  `codewhale config get telemetry` reports the resolved consent with its
  source instead of `key not found` on a machine whose batches ship. Truth
  change only; resolution and behavior are untouched.
- Fleet: a scout's read-only shell carve-out (#5428) is now honored by both
  the posture gate and the execution envelope, so `git log`, `find | head`,
  `npm view` and the other bounded read-only commands run in-place instead
  of being refused as "Executes" (#5426). Delegation still never widens
  authority: the role-isolation test and docs/SUBAGENTS.md pin that a child
  cannot exceed its parent's posture (#5426, #5435).
- `/rename` and `/title` now apply mid-first-turn: the session file does
  not exist until the first autosave, so the rename fell through with
  NotFound; the shared path now prefers the per-session checkpoint and
  rebuilds from App state, with a PTY regression test through the live
  event loop (#5430).
- `integrations dsh plan` no longer refuses DeepSeek's default
  Responses-dialect route (`deepseek-v4-flash`); Responses and
  Anthropic-Messages routes are carried through pi-ai
  `openai-responses` / `anthropic-messages` instead of being approximated
  or refused; only credentialed base URLs are still refused, with an error
  that names provider and model (#5434).
- Session cost no longer sits at `unverified_live_pricing` when live pricing
  cannot be verified (control-plane 503, Models.dev capabilities-only
  overlays): provider-docs bundled fallback rates for the DeepSeek V4
  family on Fireworks / OpenCode Zen restore a usable figure, live
  per-provider rows still win, and `kimi-k3` stays unpriced until a
  published rate exists (#5241; harvested from #5402).
- Release assets: `release.yml` asset-freshness checks compare against the
  release job's own `started_at`, so job-level reruns of the npm step are no
  longer poisoned by earlier uploads (#5429).
- macOS CI: the `agent_focus_pty` auto-review receipt test waited on a
  worker that had already completed and raced the rail's focus; it now holds
  the child's wrap-up and waits for a settled live row (refs #5056, #5403).
- DeepSeek V4 pricing follows the published peak/off-peak tiers (peak
  01:00–04:00 and 06:00–10:00 UTC; off-peak is half of peak) for
  `deepseek-v4-flash` and `deepseek-v4-pro` in USD and CNY, resolved from
  each turn's recorded time; the stale single-tier rows understated cost up
  to ~4×. Because every direct DeepSeek first-party rate is now
  time-windowed, the scorecard fails closed (`missing_recorded_time`) on an
  undated DeepSeek turn instead of guessing a tier (#5470; #5241 follow-up,
  verified against api-docs.deepseek.com on 2026-08-17).
- SSE UTF-8 split across HTTP/2 DATA frames now fails closed in every
  streaming dialect: a shared strict decoder, tail flush, and
  `decode_failed` propagation (`InvalidSseUtf8`) replace the per-dialect
  approximations, with byte-chunk decoder tests (#5374; supersedes draft
  #5404).
- CI: `release_four_read_only_fleet_roles_launch_with_canonical_prompts`
  answered Fleet children with SSE while they call the blocking JSON path;
  the parse failure was retried and double-counted the worker on slow macOS
  runners (#5471; refs #5056).
- Context: every web tool surface (`Web`, `web_search`, `web.run`,
  `fetch_url`) now uses the noisy-result soft limit, so large fetches are
  compacted like shell output instead of consuming the ordinary hard limit
  (#5474, thanks @h3c-hexin).
- Routing: a lowercase saved selector such as `glm-5.2` resolves against the
  owning Z.ai / DeepSeek catalog row (case-fold fallback, only when exactly
  one provider-owned wire id matches) instead of being classified as another
  provider's bare model (#5475, thanks @h3c-hexin; diagnosis by @asto18089
  in Pinvou/CodeWhale#14).
- Model catalog brought current as of 2026-08-17 against the official
  pricing pages: gpt-5.6-terra / gpt-5.6-luna rates, `claude-sonnet-5` keeps
  $2/$10 (the announced September increase was withdrawn), `claude-opus-5`
  added, `kimi-k3` and `kimi-k2.7-code-highspeed`, `MiniMax-M2.7-highspeed`,
  Mistral first-party rows, xAI `grok-4.5` / `grok-4.3` with long-context
  tiers, Gemini and Qwen limits, and RedNote's `dots3-note` preview as an
  OpenRouter row (no first-party API exists yet) — every number carries its
  source and a pinned test (#5485).
- Website: copy on codewhale.net rewritten in plain declarative sentences —
  one idea per sentence, numbers from the generated facts, no self-narration
  — with a voice sheet at docs/design/WEB_VOICE.md (#5483).
- CI: the release workflows no longer restore npm/cargo caches after
  checking out a caller-supplied SHA — the CodeQL cache-poisoning Highs
  #88–#107 are closed with a contract test over the workflow files (#5463).
- Compact TUI rows below 60 columns no longer reserve a hidden session-metrics
  strip, so narrow terminals reclaim the row instead of clipping the
  transcript (#5486).
- Ghostty's truecolor underwater field now uses a dedicated synchronized
  60 FPS lane instead of the legacy 30 FPS compatibility cap, with continuous
  caustic fades replacing visibly stepped color changes.
- Live reasoning's advertised `Space:expand` action now runs before the
  composer's first-character paste-burst hold, while spaces in an active paste
  remain payload. The newest reasoning preview also spends only genuinely free
  viewport rows before truncating instead of stopping at the fixed 10/12-row
  fallback on roomy terminals.
- Strict `cargo doc` builds no longer fail on bare URLs in rustdoc comments;
  the remaining links are explicit Markdown targets (#5489).

### Changed


- The model-facing `agent` tool advertises exactly 12 fields — `action`,
  `prompt`, `type`, `profile`, `name`, `agent_id`, `message`, `until`,
  `detached`, `worktree`, `write_roots`, `resume_from` — down from 33
  (#5324, refs #5123). Budgets (`max_steps`, `wall_time_secs`, `max_depth`),
  routing overrides (`model`, `model_strength`, `thinking`), worktree-path
  knobs, the deliberate/spawn-contract fields and the wait/status/interrupt
  extras moved off the advertised schema. Every removed field stays
  parse-accepted and honored unchanged (same contract as `token_budget`), so
  saved transcripts, ACP/MCP clients and Fleet configs replay as-is; the
  #5426/#5435 containment clamps are untouched. Child budgets now resolve
  from role defaults (60/120 turns, 1800 s wall time, unchanged clamps) and
  new `[subagents]` keys `default_max_steps` / `default_wall_time_secs`.
  Because the tool catalog is part of the session-pinned prompt prefix
  (docs/CACHE.md), upgrading re-fills the KV prefix once per session.
- TUI prose — user messages, assistant answers, and reasoning/thinking —
  now wraps at the full content width on wide terminals, matching
  tool/status cells, instead of stopping at a 105-column rail that left a
  dead right margin on ultrawide displays (#5436).
- Configured skill prompts are stable across session roots and operating
  systems: only custom configured roots hide their physical path, ordinary
  workspace/global skills keep a discoverable privacy-safe path, warning
  replacements are boundary-aware (including non-UTF-8 Unix paths), and
  Windows separators render as `/`. The skills prompt is also 50 bytes
  leaner without raising a runtime-contract ceiling (#5492, #5473).
- Auto-router classifier requests accept `[auto.router] timeout_secs`, while
  preserving the existing default when the key is absent (#5494).
- Every `ci.yml` job now has an explicit 10–90 minute timeout appropriate to
  its workload, bounding stale assigned runners instead of inheriting
  GitHub's six-hour default (#5495).
- The docs shell and shared web components now route localized copy through
  the typed dictionary spine; these are two incremental phases of #5337,
  not completion of the full epic (#5488, #5490).
- Dependency: rusqlite 0.40.2 (#5391).
- Documentation: stale A/B/C-tier references, provider defaults, module
  descriptions, and line anchors now match the current code (#5481).

### Added

- `[transcript] prose_measure` (positive integer, optional): caps prose
  wrap at N columns for owners who want a bounded reading measure on
  ultrawide terminals. `0` or absent keeps the full width; negative or
  non-integer values are rejected with a clear config error. Tool, diff,
  and status cells never inherit the cap (#5436).
- Localization: README translations for Français, Deutsch, 繁體中文, हिन्दी,
  Türkçe, Italiano, Polski, العربية and Català join the existing nine
  (#5451); codewhale.net routes fr, de, ca, hi, tr, it, pl and ar (with
  `dir="rtl"` plumbing) as partial locales (#5453).
- Docs: README Integrations section (incl. the DeepSeek Harness `dsh` plugin
  path, docs/INTEGRATIONS_DSH.md) localized across all READMEs; RFC keeping
  the deterministic-first auto-review hybrid (#5427); Claude Code parity
  reference for agents/workflows/plugins/skills
  (docs/design/CLAUDE_CODE_PARITY.md); config.example.toml / SUBAGENTS.md /
  TOOL_LIFECYCLE.md brought back in line with the code (#5447).
- `dsh` integration: the Codewhale palette is applied through the bundle
  profile via dsh's documented `overrideTokens` (on by default;
  `codewhale integrations dsh update --skin false` turns it off), replacing
  the 0.9.8 exported-CSS skin that dsh's inline body variables overrode
  (docs/design/DSH_BUNDLE_SKIN.md, docs/INTEGRATIONS_DSH.md) (#5469).
- `dsh` integration: an ambient ocean scene behind the DSH web UI — slow
  whale silhouettes, a school of `><>` glyph fish, bubbles — drawn on a
  canvas under a translucent veil of the Codewhale palette, plus an explicit
  responsive `WHALE BROTHERS / CODEWHALE × DEEPSEEK HARNESS` lockup; light
  and dark, ~30 fps capped, paused when hidden, a static frame under
  `prefers-reduced-motion`; on by default with the skin,
  `codewhale integrations dsh update --ocean false` turns it off (#5484).
- Fleet: agent shadowing is visible — a roster-row badge, a Layers block in
  agent detail, and a `doctor` "Fleet roster layers" section (JSON
  `operate_fleet.roster.multi_layer`), in all 15 TUI locales. Layer collapse
  and `[fleet.profiles]` migration stay for 0.9.10 (#5098).
- Sandbox: bwrap containers get the `--dev/--proc/--tmpfs` essentials plus
  configurable extra roots (`bwrap_ro_roots` / `bwrap_dev_roots`) so
  toolchains that live outside the workspace stay reachable read-only
  (#5410).
- Tests: `crates/tui/tests/README.md` states the keyless assembled-journey
  rule and maps the Auto-Review guardian acceptance items to the engine
  journeys that exercise them (#5361).
- OrcaRouter's default endpoint is classified as an aggregator billing
  surface, so pricing and session-cost reporting use the correct billing
  posture instead of treating it as a first-party provider (#5493).
- Dependencies: ratatui 0.30.2, thiserror 2.0.20.

### Removed

- `dsh` integration: the exported-CSS skin file and its "skin export" status
  line (superseded by the bundle-applied `overrideTokens` skin, #5469).

### Contributors

- hexin (@h3c-hexin) — a concrete route/offering output limit outranks the

  pricing, #5241), and @wuisabel-gif (the macOS filtered-suite hang
  investigation on #5056).

## [0.9.8] - 2026-08-16

Codewhale v0.9.8 ships the remaining assigned finish. Remaining web
settings polish moves to v0.9.9. Prefab third-party templates that have
a published OpenAI-compatible host ship here (#5350).

### Fixed

- `sudo` (and `su`/setuid helpers) work again for wheel-group administrators
  who want Codewhale to be able to escalate: the Linux startup hardening's
  irreversible `PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS` flag — inherited by every child process —
  is now skippable with `CODEWHALE_NO_NEW_PRIVS=0` (#5413). The flag stays on
  by default; the no-ptrace and no-core-dump measures are never skipped.

- Abort-class process deaths no longer poison the terminal (#5424). A
  stack overflow, allocation failure, or double panic skips the panic hook
  and every cleanup guard, which is how a v0.9.7 user's mid-turn exit left
  mouse capture leaking SGR sequences into their shell. An
  async-signal-safe handler now restores the terminal modes and appends a
  one-line cause marker to `~/.codewhale/crashes/last-fatal-signal.log`
  before re-raising, keeping the honest 128+signal wait status. A SIGKILL
  (OOM killer) remains uninterceptable by design.

### Changed

- Prompt-cache prefix is pinned for the session. The tool loop no longer
  recomposes the system prompt from disk on every model step, so an agent
  writing a file no longer busts the provider KV prefix cache mid-turn. The
  system prompt and tool catalog are re-composed only on a declared header
  change (`/model`, mode, goal, session resume), which re-pins under a logged
  reason; an undeclared change is reported as drift and the original pin is
  kept instead of silently becoming the new baseline. Workspace, AGENTS.md,
  skills, memory, and goal drift now reaches the model as one bounded
  `<context_update>` user message at the next user turn — a history append,
  not a header rewrite. `/cache stats` shows the pin reason, the last-miss
  reason, the undeclared-drift count, and the context-update count. See
  [docs/CACHE.md](docs/CACHE.md).

- Plugin compatibility is now per-component. A reviewed, trusted, enabled
  bundle that mixes Skills or MCP with unsupported commands, agents, hooks,
  LSP, native, filesystem-roots, or lifecycle-mutation declarations keeps the
  supported adapters active and reports the rest as inactive (`full` /
  `partial` / `unsupported`). All-unsupported bundles still cannot be enabled.
  The capability hash is now v2 and binds this build's activation policy, so
  older v1 receipts and any later adapter-enablement change fail closed as
  needs-review. Skills and each MCP transport re-request their own capability
  at the consumption boundary.

### Added

- Opt-in multiline composer mode (`composer_multiline_mode = true`) makes
  Enter insert a newline and Shift+Enter send. Alt+Enter, Ctrl+J, and supported
  Ctrl+Enter/Cmd+Enter behavior stays unchanged (#5345, @AiurArtanis).

- `/plugin marketplace add|list|show|remove|install` completes the
  federated marketplace journey (#5311). `add` reads one LOCAL catalog
  document in the real published schemas (Kimi, Claude, Codex, or
  Codewhale native) — no network, regular files only — and persists it
  beside the plugin state with the same hardened, fail-closed store.
  `list`/`show` render every candidate with per-entry diagnostics,
  display-only tiers, and honest install plans that say when Codewhale
  cannot fetch a source; `install` routes through the existing reviewed
  installer, so installed bundles still enter disabled and untrusted.
  Foreign auto-install policy (Codex `INSTALLED_BY_DEFAULT`) is visibly
  ignored; nothing is auto-installed, auto-trusted, or granted vendor
  trust.

- `/rc` attach now includes an observed `owner/name` git remote when the
  folder has a GitHub, CNB, or Gitee origin, so CWC can label the paired
  session. Paths stay off the wire. Reconnect after both this client and
  CWC #202 land to backfill existing empty rows.

- The local Runtime web client keeps the thread rail clipped so **New
  thread** cannot paint over the session fact chips. Chips wrap instead
  of sliding under the rail.

- Z.ai `GLM-5.3` is live on the Coding Plan and is now the default direct
  Z.ai model: `DEFAULT_ZAI_MODEL` resolves to `GLM-5.3` in both
  `codewhale-tui` and `codewhale-config`, and it is the first `/model` row
  after `/provider zai`. Explicit `GLM-5.2` selections (`model = "GLM-5.2"`
  and its `glm-5.2` aliases) keep their own id — only the default moved.
  Limits and reasoning options still inherit from `GLM-5.2` until Z.ai
  publishes distinct 5.3 numbers. No USD price is claimed. A live call
  can still 429 with entitlement code 1311 on accounts that are not
  provisioned for 5.3.

- The TUI transcript renders Markdown blockquotes (`>` lines) with a quote
  rail — nested quotes, inline bold/code/links, wrapped continuation rows, and
  selection copy that keeps the quote text and skips the rail chrome.

- Sub-agent details show the resolved model, fleet role, and type. Labels
  use the session/role name instead of a generic Agent N (#5371, #5287).

- Documented catalogue output ceilings (including DeepSeek V4's 384K maximum)
  remain authoritative bounds, while ordinary requests start at a safe 64K
  cap and explicit overrides can raise it within the resolved route window. A
  clean output-limit stop continues the turn instead of killing it (#5373,
  #5516, #5518). Thanks @sfdzhmr and @hxfhd for the route evidence.

- Ollama Cloud is a first-class hosted provider (`/provider ollama-cloud`)
  on the official OpenAI-compatible `https://ollama.com/v1` route. Local
  Ollama stays keyless. The exact released `ollama` + Cloud URL tuple keeps
  a bounded compatibility path across saved sessions, Fleet, and nested
  subagents; neighboring remotes stay custom and fail closed against
  inherited official credentials.

- Homebrew ships a `codewhale` formula. `brew tap Hmbown/deepseek-tui &&
  brew install codewhale` is the install path; `brew upgrade codewhale`
  updates it. The legacy `deepseek-tui` formula remains a deprecated alias
  for one overlap release.

- `/title [name|off]` sets a per-session tab/window title, shown as
  `[title] …` in front of the terminal window title (`Codewhale` /
  `reasoning…` / `using tool…` / `done`). The `title` config key supplies
  the default (`/config title … --save` persists it); multi-window
  workflows can tell parallel sessions apart at a glance. `/title` is
  independent of `/rename`, which keeps naming the session in the picker
  and composer. Control, bidi, and zero-width format characters are
  stripped from both the saved session name and the window title, so the
  picker, the Runtime API, `codewhale sessions`, and the OSC 0 tab title
  all carry the same escape-free text (#5419, #5430).
- Eden AI is a named OpenAI-compatible Chat Completions provider (`edenai`,
  aliases `eden-ai` / `eden_ai`) with `EDENAI_API_KEY`, global and EU base-URL
  overrides, a live provider-scoped model catalog, and
  `deepseek/deepseek-v4-pro` as the verified default. Generic reasoning fields
  stay omitted because Eden AI routes multiple upstream model families
  (#5422, Kai Nacke).
- Children (sub-agents and Fleet workers) inherit the session's permission
  posture faithfully: Auto-Review's deterministic floor and model guardian
  decide a worker's held calls (fail closed when unavailable, never a
  prompt); under Ask a held call is raised in the parent's approval UI and
  the worker waits visibly; Full Access still fails closed on the safety
  floor. Each prompt-less decision is a one-line note in that worker's
  transcript (focus mode) and an audit-log record.
- Worker role defaults keep what the role does not intend to withhold:
  every built-in role keeps network reads; `planner` may run read-only
  shell probes; `custom` inherits the parent's write/network/shell posture
  and is narrowed only by its explicit tool list or the spawning call.
  Read-only roles (`scout`, `reviewer`, `planner`, `verifier`,
  `consultant`) still never write the workspace. The focused worker's
  header states its effective posture from the runtime snapshot.
- `/workflow status`, `/workflow cancel [run_id]`, `/workflow settings`, and
  `/workflow help` are answered by Codewhale itself from the run journal and
  live run state — no model turn — and `/workflow run <path>` launches a
  checked-in workflow as-is. `/config workflow` and `/config goal` explain
  the effective tables. The workflow tool now honors the session `[workflow]`
  table (`automatic`, `auto_start_read_only`, `require_approval_for_writes`,
  limits) instead of product defaults.
- Goal mode enters as readily as DeepSeek Harness: the agent may create the
  session goal when a direct request describes a verifiable multi-turn end
  state, and Codewhale shows a one-line `Goal set` receipt with how to pause
  or clear it. Bare `/goal` shows plain progress (and how to continue when no
  turn is running), prints usage on an empty session instead of asking the
  model, and `/goal help|status` are reserved words.

- Whale Teams in the terminal: the six Signal Cut whale identities (Scout,
  Patch, Harbor, Echo, Keel, Lantern) appear as species badges on `/fleet`
  roster rows and worker rows, with an identity portrait in the roster detail
  pane and a six-state word (Resting, Thinking, Working, Waiting for you,
  Blocked, Offline) derived only from the child's real runtime status. Colors
  come from the theme tokens, every glyph has an ASCII fallback, and the
  working wake animates only under full motion. See
  `docs/design/WHALE_TEAMS_TUI.md`.
- A session metrics strip on the phase row (`4 turns · 108 steps │ LLM
  11m46s · Tool call 1m52s │ TTFT avg 1.5s · 120 tok/s │ Cache hit 99% │
  Input 9.3M`), on by default as the `session_metrics` footer item
  (`/statusline`, `[tui].status_items`). Every value comes from engine
  receipts — turn starts, per-model-call usage with stream time,
  time-to-first-token and whole-call time, tool start/complete edges, and
  provider-reported cache and input tokens. Cells without evidence are
  omitted, never estimated. `/status` prints the untrimmed line; the phase
  row sheds its lowest-value groups to fit the columns it actually has.
- Auto-Review decisions nobody was prompted for are now visible in the
  transcript as one-line notes: model-guardian allow/deny verdicts with
  their risk tier and stated reason, guardian failures (denied, fail
  closed), deterministic policy blocks, and holds Auto-Review denied
  without pausing. The audit log keeps the full record. `/permissions`
  ends with the active posture, what it decides on its own versus never,
  and the audit-log path. The footer's `Esc to interrupt` hint is
  localized. See `docs/design/AUTO_MODE_PARITY.md` for the Claude Code /
  Kimi Code parity ledger and follow-ups.
- `codewhale integrations dsh status|plan|connect|update|launch|disable|enable|remove`
  connects an existing official DeepSeek Harness (`dsh` 0.1.0-rc.6, verified)
  through Codewhale using only its documented seams: a `--patch` overlay that
  pins the exact Codewhale provider/model/endpoint identity (native
  `deepseek-official` route, or a hand-declared `openai-completions` route
  named `codewhale-<provider>` for OpenAI-compatible providers), the
  Codewhale permission posture exported as `DSH_PERMISSION_MODE`, and an
  append-only receipt. Codewhale writes only under
  `$CODEWHALE_HOME/integrations/dsh/`, never copies API keys or edits DSH
  files, never broadens permissions (`--allow-full-access` only mirrors an
  existing Codewhale full-access posture), and reports not-installed /
  offline / incompatible / detected / connected / stale-config /
  stale-version / disabled honestly. Anthropic Messages and OpenAI Responses
  routes are refused as not carriable. The documented DSH plugin path is an
  explicit opt-in: `install-bundle` materializes a Codewhale bundle package
  (`codewhale-dsh-bundle`, MIT notice retained) and installs it with
  `dsh plugin --profile codewhale add <path>` into a dedicated `codewhale`
  profile (pnpm required, reported truthfully when missing; `web`/`headless`
  untouched), so `dsh --profile codewhale` alone carries the identity;
  `update` regenerates the bundle patch and `remove-bundle` reverses it,
  leaving the DSH-owned profile directory in place. `/setup tools` and `codewhale doctor`
  show the read-only detection state; `doctor` also lists the DSH read-only
  credential consent alongside Codex and Grok. The optional `--skin` export
  writes a Codewhale token stylesheet generated from the TUI palette
  (Blue Stage dark/light, ombre water column, mode/permission/state colors,
  reduced-motion fallbacks); DSH exposes no custom-theme API, so the sheet is
  labeled an unsupported overlay and is never injected. See
  `docs/INTEGRATIONS_DSH.md`.

### Fixed

- Selecting the `google` provider kind resolved to the `antigravity`
  TUI identity (and vice versa): the agy provider entry was inserted at
  different positions in the config-level enum and the TUI's
  discriminant-indexed lookup table. The table now matches the enum, so
  provider pickers, sorted display, and kind round-trips are correct.

- The provider picker's key-entry stage accepted typed input and pastes
  for OAuth-only providers after `antigravity` declared OAuth
  acquisition; those gates now key off the OAuth acquisition class
  instead of a hard-coded provider identity.

- The webhook hook sink no longer panics when its HTTP client fails to
  build; it falls back to a default client (#5381, EvanProgramming).

- Session-index JSONL writes are serialized behind a process-wide mutex
  so concurrent state stores cannot drop an append during compaction
  (#5382, EvanProgramming; complements the cross-process file lock).

- A billed `max_tokens` stop followed by a transport error fails the turn
  instead of continuing into a second request. A clean output-limit stop
  still continues. Mid-size context windows keep the ordinary 65K internal
  reservation so compaction does not collapse to the 1K headroom floor
  when the catalogue documents a matching output ceiling.

- Thinking cycle, `/effort`, and Settings now walk each model's real ladder
  instead of the DeepSeek off/high/max shortcut. Grok 4.6 is
  auto/low/medium/high/xhigh (cannot disable); Grok 4.5 is
  auto/low/medium/high; first-party DeepSeek keeps a documented `low` tier.
  `/effort` persists and receipts through the same path as Ctrl+T.

- Google Gemini is its own backend (`/provider google`) on the official
  OpenAI-compatible route with thought-signature capture/replay and
  fail-closed replay for thinking models. Antigravity (`agy` 1.1.13) is
  a separate provider: consent-gated read-only import of the official
  CLI's login, then a text-only cloud-code stream
  (`/v1internal:streamGenerateContent`). Tools, images, and unknown SSE
  shapes fail closed. Gemini 3.7 Flash is not advertised until a live
  turn succeeds on this wire. The website 44-count still excludes
  Antigravity.

- DeepSeek Flash SSE on macOS no longer turns mid-character HTTP/2
  flushes into U+FFFD replacement characters (#5374). Invalid UTF-8
  fails the line instead of using lossy decode.

- `[workshop] read_result_max_bytes` and `tool_result_max_bytes` raise
  the model-visible read/tool-result floor; they never lower the
  compile-time defaults and cap at 2MiB (#5367).

- Fireworks and OpenCode Zen DeepSeek V4 Flash/Pro keep a bundled
  family rate when the live control plane is down, so session cost is
  not stuck on `unverified_live_pricing` (#5241). `kimi-k3` stays
  unpriced until a published rate exists.

- Provider setup ships a typed beginner template catalog (#5350). OpenCode
  Zen/Go stay first-class key-only rows with their documented hosts and
  curated models. SenseNova fills a named OpenAI-compatible table on the
  published `https://token.sensenova.cn/v1` host (`S` or `/provider setup
  sensenova`). Agnes is listed as unpublished because this repository has
  no published URL. `/provider` `P` and Settings → beginner templates open
  the list; `T` tests `/models` and refreshes status without treating 2xx
  as model-ready. `/model` names a failed Models.dev refresh as
  `refresh failed; catalog available` instead of `cache failed`.

- Privileged release workflows no longer restore rust-cache, sccache,
  or npm caches after checking out a caller-supplied SHA (CodeQL
  cache-poisoning #88–#106). Catalog drift no longer prints raw
  bundled/upstream blobs (#107).

- Cancelling a turn now cancels its foreground child agents with it.

- Empty compaction no longer wipes conversation history.

- Wide terminals and tmux panes fill the full available width again for the
  transcript and composer (#5322). The brief v0.9 session-shell side gutter
  is gone so expanding a pane rematerializes layout the same way shrinking
  does.

- The agent tool schema rejects empty calls.

- The local web client keeps recovered stream gaps closed, user questions
  answerable, manual bootstrap access intact, and streamed prose quiet for
  assistive tech.

- Website zh-Hans copy now says 宪章, matching the TUI pack (#5397,
  Lstarsky0).

- Public website provider facts include Google Gemini and Ollama Cloud
  (44 runnable routes). Antigravity stays credential-plane-only.
  Harvested from #5398 (Lstarsky0) with that correction.

- The website models page carries a truthful read-only settings preview
  built from repository facts; it never implies the site can change local
  configuration (#5370, #5411, mvanhorn).

- The canonical `ultra` reasoning effort now maps to each provider's
  maximum tier alongside the legacy `ultracode` alias, instead of being
  silently dropped (#5303, #5409, buiducnhat).

- Session titles truncate by character count, not byte offset, so
  multi-byte titles (CJK, emoji) cut at the intended width and word
  boundary instead of past the limit (#5415).
- Wide terminals and tmux panes fill the full available width again for the
  transcript and composer (#5322). The brief v0.9 session-shell side gutter is
  gone so expanding a pane rematerializes layout the same way shrinking does.
- The background verifier test drives the current libtest executable
  instead of the rustup `rustc` shim, so the TUI suite no longer depends
  on `$HOME` or holds the process-wide test environment lock across an
  async wait (#5056, #5423, Isabel Wu).

### Removed

- The source-structure budget ratchet (CI step, checker, baseline JSON).
  It measured line counts, not quality: every legitimate feature required
  a hand-edited ceiling and the accompanying "review" was self-review, so
  it bought ceremony, not protection. Behavior-measuring gates (dead-code,
  runtime-contract, persistence-backlog) stay enforced.
- DeepSeek can reuse a key already stored by official DeepSeek Harness
  (`dsh`) after
  `codewhale auth external-consent --provider deepseek --mode read-only`.
  Codewhale reads only `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` from the exact granted
  `$DSH_HOME/.credentials.yaml` and never writes or refreshes that file.
- The TUI markdown parser now honors CommonMark fence-length rules: a ````
  opener is not closed by a shorter ``` line, so `>` content inside a longer
  fence stays literal code instead of escaping into a quote.
- Sub-agents finalize when the parent session id changes, so a closed
  session cannot block new children as a live owner (#5372).
- Child spawn-route receipts stay live and usage is deduped by response
  (#5366).
- Doctor keeps persisted setup readiness across first-run / update
  checkpoints (#5340).
- Approval default selection is applied and explained; agents are told
  when approvals are disabled (#5293).
- A `/models` 2xx probe is a connection check, not model readiness.
- Site layout uses one container, the ticker no longer implies false
  provider readiness, and install links stay in the active locale.

## [0.9.7] - 2026-08-12

Codewhale v0.9.7 keeps the catalog ordinary. Grok 4.6 lands as a normal catalog
row instead of a provider-shaped pile of special cases, OrcaRouter joins as a
named provider, and a panic-safety advisory in `lru` is cleared by lifting the
pin that caused it rather than living around it.

### Added

- Grok 4.6 is the direct xAI default, with the `grok` alias moving onto it and
  `grok-4.5` still explicitly selectable. Its 500K context, text/image input,
  tool and structured-output support, `low`/`medium`/`high`/`xhigh` reasoning
  efforts (default `high`), and server-side web search all come from the
  Models.dev-shaped catalog rather than model-specific code. `reasoning_effort`
  reaches the wire only on the exact first-party `https://api.x.ai/v1` route,
  and the usage-aware 200K-token pricing boundary is scoped to direct xAI so
  aggregator routes reusing the model slug cannot inherit xAI billing.
- OrcaRouter is a first-class named provider: `ORCAROUTER_API_KEY`, default base
  URL `https://api.orcarouter.ai/v1`, `deepseek/deepseek-v4-pro` default,
  `orcarouter/auto` routing, CLI `--provider` selector, and TUI picker entries
  (#5321).

### Changed

- Reasoning-effort normalization and the model picker read a model's published
  `reasoning_options` list from the catalog instead of collapsing every route to
  the historic Low/Medium ladder. Any catalog row that publishes an effort list
  keeps its own vocabulary.
- Docs record DeepSeek's live `DeepSeek-V4-Pro-0813` backend label while the
  callable API ID stays `deepseek-v4-pro`. No aliases are remapped and no
  `deepseek-v4-pro[1m]` selector is sent.

### Fixed

- Auto-Review once again executes proven read/build/test shell commands and
  bounded workspace writes without opening an approval modal. Explicit policy
  blocks, unknown tools, publish operations, secret actions, MCP mutations,
  and shell commands requiring approval still fail closed (#5323; reported by
  USTHzhanglu and root-caused by Lstarsky0).
- Copying a user or assistant message takes its canonical content instead of
  reserialized transcript lines, keeping role glyphs, continuation rails, and
  visual wrapping out of the clipboard while preserving authored Unicode,
  Markdown, and hard line breaks. Tool and Thinking cells stay on the existing
  full-transcript path (#5319).
- `load_session` no longer runs crash recovery on every read. Snapshot reads go
  through a side-effect-free `load_session_snapshot` and recovery is explicit
  via `recover_session_for_resume`, so an embedding host inspecting a durable
  session while a tool is still running no longer gets a spurious crash repair
  (#5320).

### Security

- `lru` moves to 0.18 to clear RUSTSEC-2026-0253, where `LruCache::pop()` was
  not panic-safe and could leave dangling list pointers. The `ratatui-core`
  `=0.1.0` pin that transitively forced `lru` ^0.16 is lifted, so
  `ColorCompatBackend` now answers `get_cursor_position()` from tracked cursor
  state — the upstream-recommended workaround for the startup CPR race
  (ratatui/ratatui#2483, ratatui/ratatui#2640) that the pin originally worked
  around. `ratatui` itself stays pinned at `=0.30.0`, so the API surface is
  unchanged.

### Known issues

- The integration test
  `exec_persistent_service::failed_exec_kills_pending_service_and_exits_nonzero`
  is a confirmed flake under parallel load ("service pid file never appeared").
  It passes in isolation and is unrelated to any v0.9.7 change.

## [0.9.6] - 2026-08-11

Codewhale v0.9.6 is a subtractive release: fewer runtime guards, one stable
prompt, truthful provider endings, and a smaller compaction path that preserves
the provider cache. The changes were grounded by matched Terminal-Bench 2.1
runs against Pi 0.8.41 and by dogfooding repeated manual compaction.

### Added

- `web_search` defaults to Firecrawl Cloud without an API key; keyless requests
  are headerless and quota-bounded, while an optional user key raises limits.
- Green web builds on `main` now emit an actionable manual-deploy reminder, so
  site changes cannot quietly appear shipped while Cloudflare still serves an
  older revision.
- Mistral AI is a first-class provider route, including Codestral models,
  first-party reasoning support, authentication, picker entries, and aliases.
- Headless `Bash` can transfer explicitly requested persistent Unix services
  out of an exec run, with ownership and cleanup receipts.
- `/remote-env` opens hosted Work from the current GitHub or CNB branch tip and
  states exactly which unpushed, dirty, ignored, secret, and session state stays
  local.
- Linux ARM64 release and nightly assets are static musl builds with native
  launch checks.
- Maintainers can report observed daily active installs from the same anonymous,
  aggregate telemetry dataset; no additional client data is collected.
- Fleet-dispatched members under a read-only evidence (no-network) ceiling now
  keep the `Web` tool's read-only `search` and `fetch` actions — parity with an
  ordinary scout — while every reaching surface (`web.run`, `fetch_url`,
  `github`, MCP) stays denied and the sentinel-backed capability envelope
  remains the fail-closed backstop.
- `/fleet setup` can show an optional, deterministic, unratified role-to-model
  advisory built only from configured ready routes. Accept, edit, and reject
  all remain inside the existing human-reviewed profile save boundary; the
  advisory never launches a Fleet or writes a second configuration.
- `/update` checks for a newer Codewhale release and installs it from inside
  the TUI, while `tui_help` gives agents the same command and key map users see.
- Markdown file paths render as OSC 8 links where the terminal supports them,
  and every agent row can open that agent's transcript directly.
- ACP editor sessions can execute multi-round file, search, Git, patch, and
  explicitly enabled shell tool calls through the shared Runtime registry.
  Shell access requires both the client's terminal capability and Codewhale's
  headless shell opt-in, and cancellation stops an in-flight tool before the
  turn returns (#5225 by @rafaelcavalheri).
- Lowercase `read` returns bounded typed PNG, JPEG, GIF, and WebP results to
  image-capable Chat, Responses, Anthropic, and ACP routes. Text-only routes
  receive an explicit omission receipt; image bytes never spill into ordinary
  transcript, export, compaction, or relay text.

### Changed

- Anonymous usage counting is on by default for fresh installs and disclosed in
  a native first-run Codewhale modal with an immediate opt-out. Prior declines
  remain off. Codewhale does not collect conversations, code, prompts, files,
  repo or branch names, credentials, model content, or per-turn activity
  timelines.
- Wide terminals use a responsive, full-screen ocean canvas with modest
  gutters: prose keeps a readable measure while tools, diffs, work surfaces,
  the composer, and status chrome can use the available width. Turn and major
  activity seams breathe without padding every call inside a tool group.
- Root CLI help describes product actions directly instead of exposing internal
  TUI/runtime layers.
- `Bash action="wait"` now blocks by default when a wait is requested; callers
  can still ask for a nonblocking snapshot, and persistent service ownership
  remains explicit.
- Compaction is one cache-stable summary request followed by one committed
  replacement summary and a bounded recent-message tail. Older saved sessions
  still restore.
- Ask, Work, Auto-Review, and Full Access share one stable base prompt. Modes
  continue to differ through permissions and the live tool catalog; the former
  Act label is now Work throughout the product and shipped locales.
- Full Access now auto-approves non-bypassable tools consistently, and the
  default choice shown on ordinary approval cards is configurable.
- Model, context-window, dispatch-name, and nested-agent spawn receipts report
  the route and limits actually used rather than silently substituting a
  guessed identity.
- Child-agent launches mint one immutable route receipt before admission and
  preserve it through status, interruption, completion, resume, Work Graph,
  and ledger projections, so provider/model attribution cannot drift (#5305).
- Goal runs no longer stop because of internal continuation, repeated-gap, or
  unanswered-question guards. Explicit user limits and terminal goal states
  remain authoritative.
- Account-owned `/rc` remote control now keeps exclusive ownership and a
  crash-recoverable delivery journal until the server acknowledges terminal,
  approval, failure, and snapshot state.
- `todo_write` is an optional progress surface rather than required model
  ceremony.
- New turns use one small, stable toolbox: `read`, `write`, `edit`, `bash`,
  `agent`, `todo_write`, and `tool_search`. The optional progress tool stays
  visible as familiar working memory; specialized native, Web, MCP, plugin,
  memory, task, and verification tools are policy-filtered and searchable;
  activated schemas stay in a bounded per-conversation cache. Every sub-agent
  keeps its own search and cache, including policy-allowed Web research, while
  forked context and parent activations remain warm starts rather than allowlists.
- The direct file and shell schemas follow Pi's deliberately small contract:
  bounded complete-line reads, hash-free writes, unambiguous multi-edit with
  BOM/CRLF preservation and conservative fuzzy matching, and one foreground
  `bash` command with a bounded chronological output tail. Modes change
  execution authority, not those primitive names.
- Codewhale no longer re-states the To-do list to the model. The model learns
  what is on the list from the tool result its own `todo_write` call returned,
  which is ordinary conversation history — the same way Pi's To-do works. The
  transient `<codewhale:work_state>` block that used to ride the tail of every
  parent turn-loop and sub-agent step request is gone, along with the stable
  system prefix being disturbed by list changes. A snapshot is still shown once,
  where a person asked for it: the `<codewhale:fork_state>` block a newly forked
  sub-agent is handed, `/relay` handoff instructions, and the agent card. The
  complete To-do stays visible in the UI. A structural test asserts real
  outbound provider request bodies do not carry the list.
- Scout and Reviewer name the read-only investigator roles. Both expose exactly
  one shell entry point — canonical lowercase `bash`, bounded by the strict
  read-only classifier — and the legacy `Bash` alias stays denied in the catalog
  and at dispatch. Previously a case-insensitive name match let a call spelled
  `Bash` execute through that carve-out, returning raw shell to a read-only role.

### Fixed

- Sending more context while a lowercase `bash` command is running now moves
  the command to `/jobs` and returns a successful running receipt instead of
  falsely reporting `Command exited with code -1`; the process keeps running
  and its completion still arrives through the normal runtime event.

- First-run usage disclosure now opens as a native Codewhale modal instead of a
  shell questionnaire before application startup. Telemetry remains unarmed
  until the native choice is made, and an in-memory Disable choice governs the
  current session even when its preference cannot be saved.
- `/compact` completion, failure, queued, duplicate, and mailbox outcomes are
  durable transcript receipts instead of short-lived toasts. A stray terminal
  event can no longer leave every later compaction stuck as already running.
- Compaction now follows Codex's simple transcript shape: recent user context
  followed by one ordinary history checkpoint. It never appends the summary,
  the To-do list, or volatile shell/worker state to the standing system prompt;
  reloads migrate the persisted carrier back into exactly one history item.
- Automatic compaction uses a percentage of the real context window, clamped to
  the route's spendable ceiling. Pressure comes from the current parent-route
  prompt, not cumulative billing or child-model usage.
- Compaction, review, verify, routing, setup, Fleet, MCP, RLM, vision,
  translation, and sub-agent calls inherit the resolved route's normal output,
  sampling, and reasoning policy. Small internal-task token caps no longer
  truncate thinking routes or special-case individual providers.
- Incomplete provider responses fail truthfully across ordinary turns and every
  internal model consumer. Partial text stays interrupted, pending tool calls do
  not execute, and billed usage is retained.
- Transport-only `(reasoning omitted)` placeholders no longer enter new
  transcripts and are filtered from restored sessions. Reasoning expand/collapse
  actions stay attached to the exact rendered cell, including after replacement,
  restore, filtering, and resize (#5291).
- Step-budget exhaustion is a typed failure and cannot release a pending
  persistent service. Cancellation after terminal usage still charges the turn.
- Deferred tools now preserve a completed result when a provider reuses its
  tool-call ID on the retry turn, preventing successful plugin calls from
  entering a repeated execution loop.
- Website setup, provider, diagnostics, Fleet, and single-runtime claims now
  match the source candidate.
- Opening the sub-agent register no longer hides the to-do list: the Agents
  panel shows the full register and the durable checklist together, and the
  register header is a two-way door that returns to Tasks on a second click.
- The ⌥V / Alt+V details chord opens the selected work-surface row's own
  inspector instead of the transcript's nearest tool cell, so a selected
  to-do row shows its own content rather than the latest reasoning.
- The first-run usage disclosure now asks a clear question — "Help improve
  Codewhale?" — with unambiguous "Yes, keep anonymous counts" / "No, turn off
  tracking" choices in every shipped locale, and states the persistent opt-out
  command. Consent semantics are unchanged: telemetry stays unarmed until a
  choice is made.
- macOS screencapture screenshots referenced in a message are copied to a
  stable attachments directory the moment the message is received, and the
  reference is rewritten to the stable path, so the image still exists when
  the agent reads it. Only files under a screencapture "Temporary Items"
  directory are touched; copies are idempotent and a failed copy keeps the
  original reference.
- Manual `/compact` during an active turn now queues even when the engine's
  bounded op mailbox is saturated. The request defers client-side, retries as
  mailbox slots free, and cannot latch as already running after it settles.
- Interactive `/load`, startup `--resume`, and `/resume` picker paths preserve
  the persisted provider, endpoint, and model identity; picker resume also
  leaves a durable transcript receipt.
- Relative `mcp_config_path` values no longer depend on the launch directory or
  silently load an empty server pool: Codewhale warns and falls back to the
  user-global MCP configuration. Explicit absolute paths remain authoritative.
- Alibaba Model Studio `qwen3.8-max` and `qwen3.8-max-preview` still stream
  their current reasoning, but no longer replay historical `reasoning_content`
  that those routes do not accept. Historical reasoning replay is now gated by
  the exact provider/API/model contract, so unknown `*-thinking` lookalikes
  fail closed while documented Qwen, Kimi, DeepSeek, Mistral, Anthropic, and
  Responses continuity rules remain intact.
- Compatibility File/patch calls retain optional content-hash guards when a
  caller supplies them. The new direct `write` and `edit` schemas do not expose
  hash or prior-read ceremony.
- Shell previews hold back incomplete UTF-8 sequences instead of emitting
  replacement characters, and compaction receipts report token deltas.
- Nested agents may narrow but can never widen their inherited depth budget
  (#5317 by @ousamabenyounes).
- Container publication now assembles AMD64 and ARM64 images in parallel on
  native runners from the already-verified static release binaries, then
  publishes and checks one multi-architecture manifest. It no longer rebuilds
  both targets through the single long-running QEMU job that lost its runner.

- Google Gemini is its own backend (`/provider google`) on the official
  OpenAI-compatible route with thought-signature capture/replay and
  fail-closed replay for thinking models. Antigravity (`agy` 1.1.13) joins
  as a separate credential-plane provider: consent-gated read-only import
  of the official CLI's login with `ANTIGRAVITY_API_KEY`/`AGY_ADC_AUTH`
  precedence; requests fail closed until the cloud-code wire protocol is
  implemented.

### Removed

- The no-progress guard, repeated-read guard, and injected tool-error strategy
  coaching. Productive polling, repeated inspection, and model-owned recovery
  are no longer interrupted by runtime heuristics.
- Never-wired decision-card, keybinding, hover, shell-execution, engine-op, and
  release-script paths were deleted so the supported runtime has one route for
  each behavior.

## [0.9.5] - 2026-08-08

Codewhale v0.9.5 consolidates the terminal application into one compiled
runtime while preserving the familiar `codewhale` and `codew` commands. It
also expands the managed Runtime API, makes session and Fleet work easier to
inspect and resume, and removes the hidden local continuation backstop that
could end productive work without a final assistant response.

### Added

- **`model = "auto"` for prompt-based tier selection**: When set, the
  dispatcher analyses the user's prompt before delegating to the TUI and
  selects `deepseek-v4-pro` for complex tasks or `deepseek-v4-flash` for simple
  tasks (PR #5257).
- Runtime API controls for persistent goals, bounded memory inspection, MCP
  server and skill lifecycle management, and durable Fleet receipt evidence.
- Append-only session-tree history with `/tree`, `/branch`, `/fork`, and
  `/resume`, plus `/rc` remote control and managed login.
- A unified Fleet roster for built-in dispatch postures and a pinned indicator
  that keeps active background work visible above the composer.
- Incremental MCP registry refreshes that return the local snapshot immediately
  and update it in the background.
- Scout and Reviewer agents can use a bounded direct-command evidence shell for
  read-only workspace, Git, and GitHub inspection, and can keep private working
  notes in their own To-do while the durable transcript retains their evidence.

### Changed

- `codewhale-cli` now contains the terminal runtime directly. Release installers
  expose byte-identical `codewhale` and `codew` commands without a separate TUI
  executable. The v0.9.5 asset set alone retains deprecated
  `codewhale-tui-*` filenames as byte-identical compatibility copies so
  installed v0.9.4 clients can discover and complete this upgrade.
- Startup release checks cache successful lookups for one hour. The updater
  downloads and verifies the primary runtime once, then refreshes any existing
  `codew` or legacy `codewhale-tui` command paths from the same bytes.
- Headless `codewhale exec` runs and verifier benchmark rollouts no longer
  impose a 100-step default. `--max-turns` remains available as an explicit
  opt-in ceiling; Fleet workers retain their separately configured budget.
- Goal token and time budgets are telemetry rather than default stop
  conditions, and automatic goal continuation is unlimited unless the user
  explicitly configures a continuation ceiling.
- Command-palette and slash-completion shadowing now share one alias-aware
  discovery contract.
- The website install guidance, localized product copy, navigation controls,
  social metadata, and Cloudflare build pipeline now describe and deploy the
  same one-runtime release contract.

### Fixed

- The hidden 20-step no-user-input backstop no longer ends productive turns.
  Tool results, queued steering, child completions, REPL feedback, and goal
  continuations can all reach the next provider step and a final assistant
  response; explicit user-configured limits and genuine stuck-loop guards remain.
- Complete error details are directly inspectable after a failure instead of
  leaving the terminal with a clipped, unrecoverable error fragment.
- A newly minted OAuth credential is adopted in the same provider-selection
  flow instead of requiring a second picker trip.
- Fresh session titles can replace a stale cached `New Session` placeholder,
  unknown model context limits fail loudly, and release/source-install fallbacks
  no longer request binaries removed by the single-runtime conversion.

## [0.9.4] - 2026-08-07
Codewhale v0.9.4 ships the release-train harness work: the familiar Fleet
roster/setup face with a clear operator-leader and user/folder scope, a
work strip that keeps actionable agents instead of a permanent archive,
waiting policy that forbids polling without freezing independent work,
calmer tool output and session recovery, account/Workflow-search/
automation/handoff surfaces, a shorter translation-ready website, and
release-blocker fixes across permissions, DeepSeek Responses, SQLite,
File edits, terminal width, and Windows installation.

### Added

- Memory maintenance: `remember` gains `revise` and `retire` beside the
  default `append`. Both name the exact note they target and both require
  the evidence for the change. Append-only memory decays — a correction
  sits behind the note it contradicts and both keep reaching the model —
  so the model can now keep its own durable notes true instead of only
  adding to them.
- An audit trail for durable state the model writes about you. Every
  in-place memory edit is journalled to `memory/JOURNAL.md`, and every
  continual-harness `refine` / `remove` to a `JOURNAL.md` beside its state,
  each with before, after, and evidence. Harness removal previously left no
  record at all even though the entry leaves state entirely, so the journal
  is now the only place its content survives.
- A first-run tip that says so: the first time Codewhale saves something
  durable it points at `/memory`, translated into all fifteen complete
  locale packs. This state shaped later sessions and nothing ever mentioned
  it existed.

- Sub-agent checkpoint resume: `agents/followup` resumes an
  `interrupted_continuable` child from its checkpoint into a fresh agent loop —
  new agent id, original prompt plus the prior conversation tail — when a
  runtime is attached, and otherwise keeps queue-only semantics with the
  `continuation_handle` returned; a second followup on the same interrupted id
  returns the existing resumed target instead of spawning a duplicate (PR #5242).
- MCP Registry discovery with Registry-first tool selection: `registry_sync`
  surfaces the eligible local stdio catalog as a complete model-side candidate
  set, connect-failure messages classify early-exit and usage-help output and
  point recovery at the next Registry candidate, and a bundled `mcp-discovery`
  skill documents the flow (PR #5238).
- Progressive fresh-context disclosure: fresh sessions ship a minimal
  constitutional kernel — ground truth, user intent and scope, truthful
  completion, guarantees in mechanism, and precedence — with procedural
  playbooks disclosed on demand, an opt-in project context pack
  (`project_context_pack_enabled`) counted in context reports, and `load_skill`
  catalogue discovery via `name="list"`; the measured fresh-context budget
  drops by roughly 40% (PR #5077).
- Named Fleet store v2: one self-contained TOML Fleet per configuration
  (`schema = "fleet"`), with scope-explicit selection (user-global default vs
  folder override), migration receipts from legacy role profiles, and atomic
  saves that refuse to clobber a different Fleet on the same slug.
- Scout replaces the user-facing "faster" control: catalog-verified fast
  siblings only, never a guessed model name; pinned Scout survives operator
  changes.
- Truthful model-picker rows: vision/tools/limits chips only when the catalog
  knows, with provider → family → exact model grouping.

- **Opt-in product telemetry, off by default.** A first-run notice asks once, on
  a terminal, with declining pre-selected — Enter declines. Nothing is collected
  unless both `telemetry = true` and a recorded "Enable" answer are present, so
  a `telemetry = true` written before this release stays inert: the key has been
  settable and inert for a long time, and setting it was never consent.

  An enabled session sends its batches to the first-party ingest endpoint,
  `https://telemetry.codewhale.net/v1/telemetry`, which is the shipped default
  for `telemetry_endpoint`. That is a Cloudflare Worker whose complete source is
  in this repository under `telemetry-ingest/`; it writes to Workers Analytics
  Engine, whose row is exactly `_sample_interval`, `blob1`–`blob20`, `dataset`,
  `double1`–`double20`, `index1`, and `timestamp` — **there is no IP, country,
  or geo column**, so storing one is structurally impossible rather than merely
  disabled. The handler reads two request headers, never touches the request's
  geo properties, logs nothing, and validates against a closed field set that
  rejects an entire batch carrying any unpublished key. Cloudflare's retention
  for that data is a fixed three months. Setting `telemetry_endpoint = ""`
  instead writes each batch to `$CODEWHALE_HOME/telemetry/dryrun.jsonl` and
  constructs no HTTP client at all, so you can read exactly what would have been
  sent.

  Turning it off is an answer, not a flag: it deletes the random install id,
  truncates every buffered event, and leaves a permanent tombstone that a
  session already running re-checks before it appends and before it sends. A
  failed wipe fails closed. `CODEWHALE_TELEMETRY=0` is a hard floor that beats
  `--telemetry true` and the config key, and a value the parser cannot read
  also resolves to off. Fleet workers are hard-off. A repo-local
  `.codewhale/config.toml` can set neither key.

  Never collected: prompts, completions, tool arguments, diffs, file contents,
  filenames, paths, git remotes, repo or branch names, memory entries, chat
  history, credentials (not even a boolean asserting one exists), model ids,
  custom provider table names, MCP server names, error or panic message bodies,
  per-event timestamps, keystrokes, clipboard, screenshots, or location. The
  full schema is [`docs/TELEMETRY.md`](docs/TELEMETRY.md), and a test parses the
  field names out of that file and asserts set equality with the structs the
  serializer uses.

  This supersedes the roadmap's previous "no Codewhale product telemetry" entry,
  which moves from "Ruled out" to an opt-in framing. What stays ruled out:
  always-on or silent telemetry, per-keystroke or per-tool-call phone-home, and
  any third-party ad or analytics SDK in the runtime binary.
- Registered `GLM-5.3` (direct Z.ai) and `z-ai/glm-5.3` (OpenRouter) as
  selectable GLM routes, with their aliases (`glm-5.3`, `glm-5-3`,
  `zai-glm-5.3`, `zai-glm-5-3`). Z.ai had **not released GLM-5.3 as of
  2026-08-03** — the ids are registered so they resolve to the Z.ai/OpenRouter
  routes instead of being rewritten to another vendor's model, and they will
  fail upstream until Z.ai ships the model. Metadata (context, output,
  reasoning controls) is inherited wholesale from `GLM-5.2` pending official
  Z.ai release metadata; pricing is intentionally absent, and `GLM-5.2` remains
  the default Z.ai model. No third-party gateway roster gained the model:
  OpenCode Zen, OpenCode Go, Alibaba Model Studio, and TelecomJS publish no
  glm-5.3 entry, so Codewhale advertises none.

- Managed Codewhale account commands (`account login`, `status`, `logout`, and
  `keys`) with browser device flow, profile- and origin-scoped secure sessions,
  refresh/revocation, redacted BYOK-vault management, and a token-free Runtime
  account receipt. Provider authentication remains separate, and `cloud`
  remains a compatibility alias.
- `/automation` operator controls to list, inspect, pause, resume, delete, and
  run durable automations. Creation remains on the approval-gated
  model-visible `automation` tool.
- A provider-neutral `WorkflowSearchSpec` authoring and freeze boundary, plus
  structured 2–16-candidate experimental search in the best-of-N Workflow
  starter. It freezes baseline, route, evidence, evaluator, gate, score, budget,
  and review policy before admission; it validates gate/scoring commands but
  does not execute or certify them itself.
- The bundled generation-9 `handoff` skill for compact, decision-ready
  continuation across sessions.
- Expanded terminal LaTeX rendering for aligned and matrix environments,
  cases, arrays, text/font/accent commands, brackets, symbols, and
  command-aware scripts (PR #4981).
- Exact 40-character build provenance and secure account-session capability
  receipts on `/v1/runtime/info`; unknown source provenance continues to fail
  closed.
- Acceptance-level Gherkin coverage locking the existing user-command
  precedence, alias shadowing, fallback, and invalid-command error contract
  (PR #4992).
- Agent Plugins v1.0.0: consume, publish, and slugify packaged sub-agent
  briefs, with an install/update/uninstall on-ramp in the TUI (PR #5182). A
  plugin bundles a prompt, posture, and routing as one shareable artifact;
  on-disk migration of the older `plugin.toml` scaffold is deliberately out
  of scope for this train.
- `send_later`: a model-callable one-shot delayed continuation tool, so the
  model can schedule a single future nudge without an operator-approved
  durable automation (PR #5138).
- `/advisor`: an opt-in background advisor watcher for live turns (PR #5139).
- Notification quiet mode with per-category switches and action-first copy
  (PR #5066).
- Automation scheduling forms — one-shot `ONCE`, five-field cron, and honest
  watcher modes — created through the approval-gated `automation` tool
  (PR #5183).
- Sub-agent `resume_from` continuation chains (PR #5142), child-result
  diff-tainting when a claimed diff is not visible to git, per-turn usage
  receipts on the exec stream-json stream, and spawn receipts that report
  the model each sub-agent actually ran on.
- Transport resilience: sub-agent exec transport retries with a 600 s
  default (PR #5210), SSE header stalls retryable instead of fatal, and
  headless turn resume after mid-stream network drops with an `EX_TEMPFAIL`
  exit.
- Session durability and control: a deterministic compaction continuation
  contract (PR #5064), persisting interrupted output (PR #5206), stop-word
  cancellation (PR #5207), token-counter refresh (PR #5204), deny-by-default
  approval cards (PR #5090), and the Operate completion gate (PR #5067).
- zh-Hant promoted to a full shipped locale with complete `en.json` parity
  (PR #5143).
- A persistent update-available chip in the header, with the startup update
  check throttled and naming the right command.
- RLM static intent extraction for code blocks (`rlm_block_intent.rs`)
  landed as groundwork for a future code-mode approval flow; it is not yet
  wired into the turn pipeline and ships dormant by design.

### Changed

- `/fleet` is the familiar roster/setup face again. The operator row is the
  Fleet leader (session model); the header names the selected saved Fleet and
  whether it is user-global or folder-scoped. Named-Fleet switching lives under
  `/fleet fleets` (Enter selects in the row's own scope). Session route changes
  stay temporary until `/fleet save`, `/fleet save-as`, or `/model save-default`.
- Waiting-for-subagents directions forbid peek/status polling and sleep-as-wait,
  but allow independent work that does not depend on a child's result — the
  parent no longer freezes mid-turn with useful non-conflicting work available.
- `workflow run` no longer requires `--fleet`; a saved Fleet is an optional pin
  layer over roles + the session route.
- Homepage and getting-started copy is shorter and scannable across locales,
  with dictionary key and `{brand}` token parity preserved.

- Tool results now render as ordinary bounded previews with real expansion;
  storage, retention-ledger, and internal evidence language no longer leak into
  normal transcripts.
- Prose wrapping, goal state, modal questions, composer-tail behavior, and
  ambient motion now follow one deterministic interface contract across narrow
  terminals and fast streams.
- Scout and reviewer Fleet roles gain network access and the bounded
  verification surface for real reconnaissance while retaining the no-write,
  no-raw-shell security floor.
- Workflow runs may describe up to 1,000 tasks while admitting at most 16 live
  tasks at once through the host concurrency gate. Tournament ordering now
  supports explicit score-first selection while retaining its cost-first
  default.
- Runtime permission compatibility inputs resolve to one live
  `permission_posture`. Auto-Review can proceed without approval or structured
  question modals, unresolved holds fail closed, and a call planned under stale
  authority is retried after a posture change (PR #5025).
- Duplicate and drifting per-turn metadata has been removed in favor of
  runtime-owned authority, and large inline account and skill tests now live in
  owned test seams.
- Pinned Ratatui to 0.30.0 and ratatui-core to 0.1.0. ratatui-core 0.1.1+
  makes `Terminal::clear()` issue a blocking cursor-position report that
  raced the TUI input loop and could kill first launch; both pins are
  load-bearing, because 0.30.0 declares `ratatui-core ^0.1` and would
  otherwise resolve forward on its own (PR #5192 by @bistack; upstream
  ratatui/ratatui#2640).
- Updated globset to 0.4.19, clap-complete to 4.6.8,
  futures-util to 0.3.33, libc to 0.2.189, actions/stale to 11.0.0, and
  docker/login-action to 4.5.2. The locked graph also includes the
  event-listener 5.4.2 fix for RUSTSEC-2026-0221.
- The progress surface now speaks plainly everywhere: the last user-visible
  "Work update is pending" notices say "To-do list", the tool constructor and
  the docs name `todo_write` as the single canonical progress tool, and
  `work_update`, `TodoWrite`, and `todo` stay registered as hidden
  compatibility aliases so saved transcripts keep replaying.
- Sub-agent and `agents/wait` waits stay short by default and by cap:
  blocking waits default to 30 s and refuse to block past 120 s, because a
  blocked wait deafens the session to typed input and settled children
  already report back as `<codewhale:subagent.done>` sentinels.
- `Bash` `action=wait` honors `timeout_secs` (seconds) and bare `timeout`
  (milliseconds) alongside canonical `timeout_ms`, and `block` as an alias
  for `wait`, so a habit formed on other wait tools gets the duration it
  asked for instead of silently falling back to the 30 s default; the result
  metadata reports the real `wait_timeout_ms` applied.

### Fixed

- The memory journal is no longer indexed as memory. It is Markdown in the
  memory tree, so the source walk collected it and every retired note
  re-entered the searchable set under its `before:` line — putting the
  exact facts a revision had just removed back into the prompt.
- `memory_path` pointed at an already-native store no longer derives a
  second store nested inside it, which silently wrote somewhere other than
  the file the user named.
- `muse` and `muse-spark` resolved to `muse-spark-1.1` in the agent
  registry while config had defaulted to `muse-spark-1.2`, so the CLI and
  app-server routed those aliases somewhere the configured default never
  pointed. The registry now carries 1.2 and the contributor variant.

- An explicit `type=builder` (or its `implementer` alias) plus
  `write_authority=read_only` now fails closed at spawn instead of launching a
  labeled write role that silently had only read-only tools and then self-BLOCKED
  after burning a turn (#5123). The check is deliberately narrow, because two
  neighbouring combinations are legitimate and stay legal:
  - `type=worker` + `read_only` — worker is the unnamed default (it renders as
    `general`) and takes its capability from authority, not from its name, so a
    read-only worker is an ordinary general-purpose child. Worker, scout,
    reviewer, and verifier remain the four canonical read-only Fleet roles.
  - any `role` + `read_only` — `role` is an identity for roster resolution, not
    a capability claim, so an acceptance Workflow can still resolve
    `implementer` to its saved profile while scoping that child to verification.

  Callers that spelled a read-only narrowing as `type: "implementer"` should
  move it to `role: "implementer"`.
- User-global credentials survive an explicit workspace `CODEWHALE_CONFIG_PATH`
  that selects a route with no local key — readiness probes the user-global
  provider table before concluding a key is missing.
- Sub-agent token figures on the work bar accumulate input+output (the same
  total the worker budget uses) instead of completion tokens alone; elapsed
  time still freezes when the child settles.
- Live work-bar rows for sub-agents show how many to-dos they still have
  left (`N left`) when the child's own list has unsettled items — never a
  fabricated zero when no list exists.

- Surfaces no longer claim an OS sandbox on platforms that cannot enforce one.
  The policy resolver takes no platform input, so on default Linux (bubblewrap
  is opt-in) and on all Windows the header chip read `files: workspace` and
  `/status` read `sandbox workspace-write` while nothing was restricted. Both
  now resolve the real backend and say `(unenforced)`.
- `tool_category` hook conditions matched only retired tool names, so a
  `category = "shell"` **deny** hook — the security control `docs/HOOKS.md`
  documents — silently never fired. Categories now use the registered names,
  and multi-action tools classify by action.
- A `Retry-After` header of `-5`, `nan`, or `1e300` crashed the request task
  (`Duration::from_secs_f64` panics on a negative). Parsing is now guarded and
  bounded to one hour.
- Bearer tokens no longer leak into operator-visible receipts. `Authorization:
  Bearer <jwt>` split into two tokens and the JWT matched no redaction rule;
  prefix matching was also case-sensitive, so `SK-live-…` survived.
- `prune_older_than` destroyed the NEWEST rollback snapshots and kept the old
  ones — on every boot, for any workspace with snapshots spanning the retention
  window. Both prune paths now share one orphan-chain rebuild and preserve each
  survivor's real timestamp.
- An absolute or relative command path no longer defeats every execpolicy deny
  rule (`/bin/rm -rf /` did not match a `rm -rf /` rule), and a typed `Allow`
  rule no longer auto-approves a chained suffix such as `git log ; curl … | sh`.
- Wrong types on `File` read range params and `Bash` stdin/cwd/task_id are now
  errors instead of silent defaults — a `start_line:"1200"` string used to
  return the head of the file, and a non-string `stdin` ran the command with no
  stdin and reported success.
- Multibyte tool ids no longer panic the context inspector, wide (CJK) text no
  longer overflows the decision card, and a hostname like `127.evil.example.com`
  is no longer treated as loopback.
- Refusals name calls the model can actually make (`rlm action='open'` rather
  than a retired `rlm_open`; `Bash` rather than `exec_shell`).

- Sub-agent dispatch no longer aborts the process. The Tokio runtime was built
  by `#[tokio::main]`, leaving every worker thread on the 2 MiB default while
  only the owner thread received the explicit 16 MiB stack — and the engine runs
  on a worker. A debug-build `agent` dispatch exceeded that stack and raised
  SIGABRT, which is not a panic and so could not be caught; the process died
  mid-spawn with no child request ever issued. Release builds were unaffected.
- Fleet profiles that pin a provider no longer leak a bare model id onto the
  session route. `model_overrides` exported each role's model while dropping its
  provider, so a scout pinned to another provider's model was dispatched against
  the active client and denied at the wire — visible as an instant auth failure
  on the first sub-agent of a fan-out.
- The rail's Pinned panel no longer spends four rows saying "No active work".
  An empty panel now collapses like the Tasks panel always has, and the settings
  migration no longer folds the default `sidebar_focus = "auto"` into a pinned
  always-on strip, which had silently handed that panel to every user who had a
  settings file at all. (An *empty* panel collapses; a panel holding settled
  to-dos or finished workers is not empty — see the standing-register entry
  below.)
- The work bar keeps settled to-dos and an honest Subagents header, while
  completed/cancelled workers collapse out of the Top strip so fan-outs do not
  permanently eat the transcript. Failed or interrupted workers stay visible
  (they still need attention). Settled agents remain reachable through the
  Agents panel and catalog. To-do rows say their state in words (pending /
  in progress / completed / cancelled), and sub-agent rows carry type,
  objective, elapsed, and input+output tokens. Every work row is a door in
  every rail panel and placement: click and Enter open the row's world
  (work inspector / agent details — finished agents included) instead of
  doing nothing. A click after the detail pager closed itself reopens the
  detail rather than being swallowed by a stale toggle.
- The rail strip yields its rows to the transcript when the terminal cannot
  seat both, so the idle ocean survives at 24 rows instead of being evicted.
- `code_execution` and `js_execution` no longer describe themselves to the model
  as sandboxed. Both are ordinary local subprocesses with no seccomp, jail, or
  container (PR #5221 by @h3c-hexin and @asto18089).
- Model Studio reasoning controls now fail closed on the host rather than on the
  provider enum, so a custom `base_url` no longer receives Alibaba-specific
  `enable_thinking` fields, and `qwen3.8-max` is no longer sent a thinking
  switch it does not accept (PR #5233 by @Inference1, closing #5203).
- `config.example.toml` no longer claims Shift+Tab cycles the reasoning tier.
  Shift+Tab cycles the permission posture; Ctrl+T cycles reasoning
  (found by @vFONGv, PR #5229).

- Alibaba Model Studio reasoning controls are now route- and model-scoped
  instead of provider-wide (#5203, harvested from #5233 by
  [@Inference1](https://github.com/Inference1)). Codewhale sends
  `enable_thinking` / `preserve_thinking` / `reasoning_effort` only when the
  configured `base_url` is a verified Alibaba Chat Completions host, so
  pointing a `modelstudio-*` provider ID at a custom gateway no longer injects
  DashScope's dialect into it. `qwen3.8-max` and `qwen3.8-max-preview` are
  thinking-only and no longer receive an `enable_thinking: false` they cannot
  honor; `preserve_thinking` is sent for the models documented to accept it, so
  their reasoning trace survives into the next turn; and `deepseek-v4*` /
  `glm-5.x` map the reasoning tier onto the documented `high` / `max` ladder.

- xAI device login now recovers from a config that points at a missing
  Codewhale-owned credential generation instead of failing every attempt
  with a generic activation error, and finalize failures report the full
  error chain (#5032).
- API keys saved to the secret store no longer read as unconfigured for
  providers that are not currently active; a configured Kimi/Moonshot key
  survives provider switches and restarts without re-entry (#5033).
- Switching to the Codex provider with no saved model now lands on the live
  roster's flagship model instead of a stale static default (#5034).
- Worktree-isolated Fleet builders no longer contend on the per-workspace
  delegated-coordination lock, and a failed lock acquisition is retried on
  use instead of being memoized for the life of the process (#5036).
- Fleet dispatch now rebinds the child client when the resolved profile
  model requires a different wire protocol (DeepSeek flash on Responses),
  instead of failing deterministically on the worker's first request
  (#5042).
- DeepSeek Responses now sends `reasoning.effort: "none"` for the Off tier,
  shows a truthful notice instead of silently discarding server-side
  `web_search_call` items, and parses cache-hit, cache-miss, cache-write, and
  pricing telemetry while retaining the OpenAI-style nested fallback.
- File edits now explain no-op and missing-search failures, reject newly
  unbalanced C/C++ preprocessor replacements, handle the reported
  CRLF/non-ASCII cases, and safely relocate stale unified-diff hunks only when
  whole-file context is unique (PRs #5008 and #5030).
- Circled digits, enclosed alphanumerics, and keycap graphemes use consistent
  two-column measurement in Codewhale, Ratatui, and CJK terminals, preventing
  missing-character and phantom-space corruption (PR #5001).
- SQLite connections install their busy timeout before locking setup and avoid
  rewriting persistent WAL mode on every open, removing the concurrent-open
  release-gate failure.
- The Windows installer preserves long current-user `PATH` values, their
  registry type, and unrelated entries across install and uninstall (PR #5006).
- Provider configuration no longer contains user-reachable panic paths when
  metadata or prior credential state is missing.
- Resuming a session restores composer text only from a same-session persisted
  draft; submitted prompts and internal background-runtime envelopes remain in
  history instead of appearing in the composer (PR #5029).
- Shared CI now handles bot-authored issue-link checks, provisions cargo-deny's
  toolchain, and fetches the locked test graph before offline runtime-budget
  validation.
- Re-quote each linker argument in the Windows OpenHarmony clang launcher so a
  spaced SDK path (e.g. the default `D:\DevEco Studio\...` install) keeps its
  `--sysroot` intact through the final Rust link, and extend the no-SDK release
  guard to keep the re-quoting contract (PR #5095).

- The shell tool reports the real elapsed wait time in its result content
  instead of echoing the requested timeout (PR #5240).
- Transcript wheel scrolling under iTerm2: xterm alternate-scroll (DECSET
  1007) now stays off while mouse capture is active, so wheel events arrive as
  mouse events instead of being converted into arrow keys (#5223, PR #5234).
- A stalled model stream no longer ends the turn as `Completed` over a
  frozen reasoning block: a mid-stream chunk-timeout now counts toward the
  stream-error budget, so a stall with nothing streamed retries the request
  transparently, and a stall that exhausts the retry budget fails the turn
  with the real reason instead of reporting success.
- A finished background shell task now wakes the engine even when no goal is
  active: the idle loop starts an ordinary runtime turn so the completion
  reaches the model immediately instead of sitting unclaimed until the user
  types (a dead provider route claims the completion once and reports where
  the output lives instead of re-arming the same error every tick).
- Sub-agent final reports that exceed the summary budget are now spilled to
  a session artifact, and the truncation footer names the
  `retrieve_tool_result` ref for the elided middle instead of telling the
  model the bytes are unrecoverable; write failures degrade to the honest
  no-ref footer.
- An interactive mid-stream network drop after partial output no longer fails
  the turn: the partial reply is preserved as a committed assistant message,
  a runtime continuation message is appended, and the request is re-issued
  bounded by the stream-retry budget.
- Large pasted input is no longer sent to the model twice as inline text and
  as a backup `.md` paste file; the submitted message now carries only the
  `@`-mention so the model reads the file once.
- A builder sub-agent can run ordinary shell writes again. Write claims
  outlive the agents that register them, so a workspace accumulated one per
  builder that ever ran — six completed agents left four standing claims in
  testing — and the shared-checkout gate counted those long-finished children
  as live contenders. Every later builder was refused `Bash` writes with
  "cannot prove a bounded file target" and pushed toward worktree isolation,
  which puts the work in a checkout the operator never looks at. The gate now
  asks the question it meant to ask: is another *running* child writing in this
  shared checkout. Concurrent writers are still gated; a lone builder writes in
  the workspace you are actually watching.
- Ctrl-C during the first moments of startup no longer kills Codewhale
  outright. The terminating-signal handlers were registered inside the task
  that waits on them, and a spawned task does not run until the scheduler
  first polls it, so a SIGINT arriving in that window hit the default
  disposition — the process died with no exit code, no terminal restore, and
  no session record. The handlers are now installed synchronously, before
  the telemetry notice and before arming, so the window is closed.
- The documented tool list on the docs site named `update_plan` and
  `work_update` as coordination tools. Neither is callable by the model —
  `update_plan` replays older Plan artifacts and `work_update` is a hidden
  compatibility alias — so the page listed two tools a reader cannot use and
  omitted `todo_write`, the one they can.

### Security

- Bumped `nanoid` past GHSA-2v37-7h3g-55p8 (a custom generator given size
  zero could loop indefinitely), restoring a zero-advisory `npm audit` for
  the website.

- Google Gemini is its own backend (`/provider google`) on the official
  OpenAI-compatible route with thought-signature capture/replay and
  fail-closed replay for thinking models. Antigravity (`agy` 1.1.13) joins
  as a separate credential-plane provider: consent-gated read-only import
  of the official CLI's login with `ANTIGRAVITY_API_KEY`/`AGY_ADC_AUTH`
  precedence; requests fail closed until the cloud-code wire protocol is
  implemented.

### Removed

- The default model-facing SlopLedger implementation, its storage-oriented
  transcript language, and the `/debt`, `/cleanup`, `/slop`, and `/canzha`
  command surface.

## [0.9.3] - 2026-07-31

This is the Codewhale v0.9.3 source candidate. It is not a published release
until the matching tag, packages, checksums, and release assets exist.

DeepSeek V4 Flash is now a first-class Codewhale route, and the agent-facing
tool surface has been reduced to the canonical action tools that current
models actually need. This release also hardens credential, authorization,
durability, compaction, and macOS File Provider boundaries while deleting
stale runtime and dependency surface.

### Added

- Native `deepseek-v4-flash` support over DeepSeek's Responses API, including
  stateless reasoning-item replay, semantic SSE terminal events, structured
  function calls and outputs, `apply_patch`, and model-aware wire-format
  selection. Exact current Flash IDs use Responses; future direct
  `deepseek-vN-*` model IDs inherit that route conservatively, while custom
  DeepSeek-compatible endpoints retain Chat Completions unless configured
  otherwise.
- A pipe-only `codewhale auth print-api-key` handoff for explicitly selected
  providers. It shares Codewhale's home-scoped credential authority, refuses
  terminal output, and prevents sentinel placeholders from becoming live
  credentials.
- Per-turn `max_tool_calls` enforcement at the engine admission gate, plus a
  named-file write scope with a separate read seam. The runtime now rejects
  over-budget calls before execution and keeps the operator's write boundary
  explicit (#4415).
- Runtime-contract, source-structure, and persistence-backlog ratchets that
  name drift instead of allowing large ownership surfaces to grow silently
  (#3921, #4785).

### Changed

- Model-visible built-ins now use the canonical `Bash`, `File`, and `Run`
  action schemas. `apply_patch` remains available as the one direct custom
  edit tool supported by DeepSeek Responses. The bundled stop-ship workflow,
  Fleet fixtures, shell shortcut, and engine tests use the same canonical
  vocabulary.
- Canonical `File { action: "write" }` requests now pass through the same
  semantic repo-law checks as the former write path. Approval, Full Access,
  and workflow execution cannot bypass the repository safety floor by choosing
  the canonical schema.
- Codewhale home resolution is shared across the CLI, TUI, state, and secret
  stores. `doctor` is offline by default, distinguishes credential source from
  availability, and reports one consistent path snapshot.
- Durable runtime event writes are serialized across simultaneous processes,
  blocking history waits move off async workers, and provider quota exhaustion
  remains typed and retryable through compaction (#4522).
- Skill discovery caches the merged catalog behind watched-mtime validation;
  large skill, engine, subagent, UI, and ambient-ocean test blocks now live in
  owned test seams.
- Reasoning summaries stay in the user's language, complete jellyfish
  silhouettes relocate around transcript text, and cached ocean frames include
  their palette identity (#4807).
- The authorization-order contract now documents and tests how modes, hooks,
  permission rules, safety floors, repo law, approvals, and sandboxing compose
  (PR #4980).

### Fixed

- macOS sandbox extensions cover CloudStorage/File Provider workspaces without
  broadening unrelated paths; thanks @Watcher24 for the #4085 report and
  reproduction.
- Foreground shell state detaches before steering, so an interrupted command
  cannot keep owning the composer (PR #4979).
- MCP application-level failures and malformed error envelopes fail closed
  instead of looking like successful tool output.
- Optional PDF failures are truthful and PDF classification no longer misses
  supported inputs.
- Bracketed-paste contents are redacted from traces, and credential diagnostics
  never treat placeholder sentinels as usable keys.

- Google Gemini is its own backend (`/provider google`) on the official
  OpenAI-compatible route with thought-signature capture/replay and
  fail-closed replay for thinking models. Antigravity (`agy` 1.1.13) joins
  as a separate credential-plane provider: consent-gated read-only import
  of the official CLI's login with `ANTIGRAVITY_API_KEY`/`AGY_ADC_AUTH`
  precedence; requests fail closed until the cloud-code wire protocol is
  implemented.

### Removed

- The legacy callable aliases `exec_shell`, `run_shell_command`, `read_file`,
  `write_file`, `list_dir`, `grep_files`, `file_search`, and the duplicate
  Work/RLM registrations. Historical transcript and policy semantics remain
  readable, but new model turns receive only the canonical action surface.
- The bundled PDF parser dependency chain, replacing it with the smaller
  optional extraction boundary tracked by #4382.

### Contributors

- [Turisla](https://github.com/greyfreedom) (`@greyfreedom`) documented and
  locked the authorization-order contract in PR #4980.
- [Nightt](https://github.com/nightt5879) (`@nightt5879`) fixed foreground
  shell detachment before steering in PR #4979.
- [Watcher24](https://github.com/Watcher24) (`@Watcher24`) provided the macOS
  File Provider report and reproduction for #4085.
- [Fred Leitz](https://github.com/fleitz) (`@fleitz`) retains required
  source-candidate credit for the canonical `Bash` workspace fix from PR #4673
  and issue #4674.

## [0.9.2] - 2026-07-29

This is the Codewhale v0.9.2 source candidate. It is not a published release
until the matching tag, packages, checksums, and release assets exist.

### Changed — behavior

- **Legacy `model = auto` no longer elects a network classifier on its own.**
  Holding a DeepSeek API key used to silently select `deepseek-v4-flash` as the
  classifier for every Auto turn — a per-turn cost on a route nobody asked for,
  and one provider privileged over the rest. Auto now stays local and free
  unless an explicit `[auto.router]` block names a provider and model.

  **If you relied on the implicit default**, restore it explicitly:

  ```toml
  [auto.router]
  provider = "deepseek"
  model = "deepseek-v4-flash"
  ```

  `[auto.router]` remains legacy `model = auto` configuration. It is unrelated
  to a Fleet's Adaptive Reasoning Router, which is a saved service referenced by
  name from a Fleet file and decides only how hard an already-frozen route
  thinks.

Landed since v0.9.1, not yet released. A cluster of defects found by a
read-through audit of the policy engine, the MCP proxy, the session index,
and the app-server bridge — several of them cases where the wrong outcome
was reached silently, behind a response or a log line that looked fine. The
release also adds opt-in session, reasoning, localization, and inspectability
surfaces; existing defaults remain stable unless an entry below explicitly
says otherwise.

### Added

- `/permissions` now lists the active user permission-rule source, each rule's
  effective matcher and global/repository scope, and whether that scope applies
  in the current workspace. `/permissions remove <number>` previews deletion
  and requires a snapshot-bound confirmation token, so a concurrent edit
  cannot move a different rule under the confirmed index. Appends and removals
  share one adjacent lock, preserve unrelated TOML formatting and comments,
  atomically replace `permissions.toml`, and reload the live user ruleset
  without clearing session-only approvals. `/config ask-rules` remains a
  compatibility entry; rule creation, glob/directory rules, and deny
  persistence remain out of scope (#1186, PR #4960 by @greyfreedom).

- `/preview-request` (aliases `/dryrun` and `/preview_request`) is a human-only,
  provider-free inspection of the next primary turn. Production dispatch and
  preview share one prepared-request seam across Chat Completions, Anthropic
  Messages, and OpenAI Responses, so the manifest reads the final wire model,
  reasoning controls, tool choice, tool schemas, and body hash from the same
  value production sends. Route, tool, or body facts that require Auto's
  provider classifier, an MCP connection, mutable hooks, compaction, or queued
  runtime injections remain typed unavailable. The manifest reports exact
  primary role/lane identity, upstream route-source provenance, requested and
  effective reasoning, canonical JSON sizes, conservative offline estimates,
  and provider-reported usage as unavailable because no request ran. It never
  adds a model-visible tool, sends a provider call, or prints prompt, message,
  credential, endpoint-path, or workspace-path content. The explicit
  `/preview-request base-prompt` mode prints only the exact effective base
  prompt; effective system text remains protected behind its final hash. The
  exact body includes the same authoritative transient Work/To-do tail used by
  production, including graph-backed state newer than the legacy projection.
  Preflight preserves production's separately framed base-plus-Work estimate,
  and fails closed when the authoritative projection is unavailable. An
  exhausted active goal token budget also produces a typed unavailable result
  before any outbound request is built.
  (#1004, #3928; dry-run concept harvested from PR #1099 by @GTC2080 / TaoMu.)

- Slash commands, hotbar actions, and CLI entrypoints for the same Lane/Fleet
  lifecycle operation now share one typed control-plane contract
  (`codewhale-lane::control`): a stable `<domain>.<verb>` id, read-vs-write
  authority, persistence scope, exact-identity target selection, retryability,
  lifecycle outcome, and one bounded, sanitized receipt. `docs/COMMAND_CONTROL_PLANE.md`
  documents it (#1888).

- `/lane [list|status|interrupt|restart|resume]` — durable Lane control from the
  composer, backed by the same executor `codewhale lane …` calls. `codewhale
  lane interrupt|restart|resume` are the matching CLI verbs; `lane stop` stays as
  a compatibility spelling of `lane interrupt`. Appending `@<lifecycle-seq>` to a
  lane id fences a write to the exact durable generation you observed, so a
  concurrent transition is rejected as a conflict rather than acted on (#1888).

- `codewhale fleet list` and `/fleet [list|status|interrupt|resume]` — durable
  Fleet run inspection and control from either surface, through shared DTOs that
  carry the exact provider, provider-table id, model, effective reasoning tier,
  and route source when the ledger records them, and a typed `not_recorded` /
  `not_applicable` / `redacted` reason when it does not. Requested-vs-effective
  reasoning is never back-filled: the ledger persists the effective tier only, so
  the requested tier reports `not_recorded` (#4022).

- The bundled skill pack now ships a `help` skill (catalog generation 7). It is
  `invocation: explicit-only`, so it never enters the model's ambient catalogue
  and costs no prompt budget. Its body is a routing card that points at the
  surfaces this build actually exposes — `/help` and `/help <command>`,
  `/skills` and `/skills inspect`, `/config`, `doctor`, and the `docs/` tree
  when the workspace is a Codewhale checkout — and explicitly forbids pasting a
  command list or settings table into context (#4698).

- `crates/tui/assets/skills-catalog-matrix.json`: an authored, provider-free
  expectation matrix covering every bundled skill (tier, invocation, aliases,
  ambient-catalogue eligibility, shadowed aliases). Contract tests in
  `crates/tui/src/skills/catalog_matrix.rs` assert a bijection between the
  fixture and the shipped bundle, so the starter pack cannot change without an
  explicit fixture update. The matrix covers positive eligibility and explicit
  load, non-activation negatives, alias resolution, explicit-only exclusion,
  alias-vs-canonical collision precedence, and prompt-budget invariants (no
  duplicate catalogue entries, no aliases as extra entries, and the shipped
  pack fitting inside the 12 000-char budget with no omitted-skills line). These
  are deterministic registry/catalog/resolver assertions and make no claim about
  semantic model routing (#4698).

- Locale-routing coverage for the complete bundled catalog across every shipped
  locale (`en`, `ja`, `zh-Hans`, `zh-Hant`, `pt-BR`, `es-419`, `vi`, `ko`). No
  bundled skill ships a localized routing description and none was invented;
  the tested contract is deterministic fallback to the canonical English
  description, with the rendered catalogue byte-identical across locales.
  Exact-tag match, primary-subtag fallback, and English fallback are covered
  against a synthetic authored fixture, and the parity test fails if a bundled
  skill ever gains localized metadata without source-backed coverage (#4698).

- `docs/LIVE_SMOKE.md`: copy-pasteable, opt-in live-smoke instructions for Kimi
  K3 and a second provider/model (DeepSeek). The runs are manual only — nothing
  in CI, tests, or skills invokes them. They use `env -i` plus a throwaway
  `CODEWHALE_HOME`; `HOME` is left unset rather than repurposed, and ambient
  provider variables are not forwarded. The operator names the credential
  variable explicitly, and the isolated child reads its value with echo off,
  restores the prior terminal state on exit or interruption, and never persists
  the value or puts it in a command argument. The page states the expected
  route/model/reasoning/tool receipt fields while treating provider errors as
  unclassified until provider configuration, authentication/entitlement, and
  harness behavior have been corroborated independently (#4698).

- Approval cards can now remember eligible safe shell and file-write approvals
  as exact `allow` rules scoped to the current repository. Remembered shell
  commands use complete-command matching, validated file and patch paths remain
  workspace-relative, and dangerous, critical, or repo-law-held requests stay
  ineligible and continue to require review.

- `tui.header_items` (array of strings, optional, default `[]`): an opt-in
  header chip showing cumulative session token usage as input / cache-hit /
  output. Set `header_items = ["tokens"]` under `[tui]` to enable it. The
  chip is the only elidable element of the header — the git label, context
  meter, and version stamp keep their space, and narrow terminals drop the
  chip rather than the baseline chrome. Unknown entries are warned about and
  skipped so configs written by newer builds stay loadable by older ones
  (#4520 requested by @eugenicum; PR #4610 by @XhesicaFrost, harvested with
  co-authorship).

- `thinking_default_expanded` lets reasoning blocks start open while keeping
  Space as the per-block toggle. The setting is persisted, available through
  native and runtime configuration, and documented for SSH/tmux accessibility
  (issue #4925 and PR #4928 by @M-Maciej).

- The transcript renders a conservative subset of LaTeX math as readable
  Unicode without rewriting fenced/inline code, ordinary currency, escaped
  dollars, or unknown commands. The contribution from PR #4973 by
  @SparkofSpike was hardened and landed through PR #4974; reported by
  @antarikshraya in #4957.

- Session control now includes a sessions rail, shared archive projection,
  picker archive controls, and opt-in interactive auto-resume with explicit
  handoff behavior. The work closes the remaining session-browsing direction
  from #2934; thanks @cy2311 for the original report.

- The bundled contributor-onboarding skill can sync contribution context,
  select the appropriate gate, and prepare a digest without inflating the
  ambient skill catalog. It follows the contributor-navigation request in
  #4227 by @JayBeest.

- Bahasa Indonesia now has a complete repository documentation suite and a
  registered website dictionary alongside the shipped TUI locale (PRs #4962
  and #4972 by @atmosuwiryo, closing #4789).

- Reasoning content can keep its rail, italics, cursor, and expansion controls
  while disabling only the warm background highlight. The independent setting
  is persisted and localized (#4089; reported by @elijahchan2019).

- StepFun setup now asks whether a key belongs to PAYG or Step Plan, keeps the
  two endpoint/billing routes distinct, and localizes the choice across the
  complete packs (#4526; reported by @whp233).

- OpenCode Zen is a separate model-aware API-key provider. Its curated catalog
  selects Responses, Anthropic Messages, or Chat Completions per model;
  unsupported Gemini and unknown models fail closed, and missing Zen
  credentials never fall through to ChatGPT/Codex OAuth guidance. The
  implementation from closed PR #4467 by @snail-vs (snailoniu) is preserved in
  the candidate.

- Markdown exports correlate prompts with stable workspace restore-point ids
  and say when correlation is unavailable or ambiguous, completing the
  remaining restoration/export direction from #2494 by @wywsoor.

### Fixed

- Permission setup now consistently presents the product postures Ask,
  Auto-Review, and Full Access instead of leaking the internal `never` token.
  The same resolved sandbox policy now drives execution and UI receipts: Plan
  stays read-only, Ask and Auto-Review stay workspace-scoped, and Full Access
  is actually unsandboxed unless a stricter effective configuration wins.

- Fleet setup no longer stalls when a user explicitly selects a configured
  Codex or Grok external-consent route. The selected route is activated and
  validated before saving, roster roles open directly on their Model step,
  Review saves on the first Enter, and new profiles default to the personal
  profile directory that the roster loads on the next session.

- Provider credential dialogs now share one wrapping, secret-safe API-key
  surface across every non-OAuth provider. A key already present in durable
  storage is reported as configured without rendering it, typing or pasting is
  clearly framed as replacement, narrow help text remains visible, and Codex
  and Grok OAuth flows remain token-free in this modal.

- Ctrl+O again opens the complete recorded reasoning detail for the selected,
  active, or latest reasoning block. The whole-turn Turn Inspector moved to
  Ctrl+Alt+O and `/turn inspect`, removing the shortcut collision while keeping
  raw leaf detail and post-flush reasoning discoverable.

- Failed child agents now deliver a distinct high-priority failure receipt to
  their owning parent with a sanitized failure class, elapsed work, and a full
  transcript handle. Parent-to-child message, follow-up, and interrupt tools
  now use one hierarchy-checked mailbox path, and persisted nested completion
  envelopes remain safely restorable across instruction-text revisions.

- Background-shell completion events now carry only bounded tails plus a
  retrievable exact-evidence handle. Terminal foreground Bash results are
  acknowledged at the direct tool-result boundary and are no longer emitted a
  second time as background completion artifacts.

- Providerless Fleet and child-agent fixed-model routes now reject only
  high-confidence foreign-provider model ids before creating a worktree, while
  explicit provider/model pairs, custom and local endpoints, unknown ids, and
  aggregator wire-id resolution retain their intended behavior.

- Manual compaction now preserves and reports the supplied provider failure
  class instead of replacing it with an opaque generic error. This does not
  infer quota exhaustion when the recorded failure does not prove it.

- The ambient jellyfish keep complete, readable silhouettes while animating,
  and the website favicon now uses the Signal Current desktop tile instead of
  the legacy whale mark.

- ACP JSON-RPC responses preserve numeric request ids for avante.nvim while
  retaining the negotiated string-id exception for Zed (PR #4929 by
  @atmosuwiryo).

- Restored shell cells whose job no longer exists stop displaying live
  spinners and settle into a truthful stale/no-output state across transcript,
  phase strip, and sidebar (PR #4937 by @LI-Jialu, closing #4547).

- Interrupted checkpoints and timed recovery snapshots remain checkpoints
  instead of being promoted into orphan session files, preventing duplicate
  `/resume` entries (PR #4963 by @SparkofSpike).

- Every shipped locale is admitted by the typed settings schema and native
  chooser, with complete/partial status kept independent and tested (PR #4856
  by @nightt5879, closing #4786). Context-menu hover hit-testing also accounts
  for its title row (PR #4897 by @XhesicaFrost; reported by @SparkofSpike in
  #4803).

- OSC 52 and SSH/tmux clipboard transport run on one bounded background worker
  rather than blocking input and rendering on the TUI loop; late transport
  failures still surface through the status path (PR #4896 by @nightt5879,
  closing #4159).

- Non-streaming model calls receive a generation-length response budget rather
  than the SSE header-open timeout, while actual SSE opens share the bounded
  cross-provider transport seam. The equivalent fix direction came from
  closed PR #4743 by @vibecoding-skills.

- Resumed sessions diagnose a deleted inherited workspace before shell launch
  instead of failing as an opaque Windows process error (report #4100 by
  @redjade75723). DeepSeek native tool-call wrapper tokens are also scrubbed
  from visible streaming and completed output as a grounded fail-soft follow-up
  to report #3880 by @hardy922; that report's exact emitted marker remained
  unconfirmed.

- Auto model routing now preserves the user's requested reasoning effort
  through startup, provider/model changes, session restore, the picker,
  Ctrl+T, and Hotbar actions. The tier is normalized only after the concrete
  provider route is known instead of being silently replaced by Auto
  (#4941, PR #4961 by @nightt5879).

- Auto-compaction now defaults on for every known model context window,
  including Kimi K3's 1,048,576-token routes. Persisting only an
  `auto_compact_threshold` or `auto_compact_threshold_percent` now counts as
  opt-in intent, while an explicit `auto_compact = false` remains authoritative.
  `/config` reports the effective state, percentage, and computed token trigger.

- Per-provider `context_window` overrides are now documented and visible in
  `/config`, provider setup help, diagnostics, and the example configuration.
  The effective override consistently drives preflight budgeting, the context
  meter, and compaction; this lets a user cap a 1M Kimi route to 256K when their
  Coding Plan tier has the smaller window.

- Agent Details now projects status, model, elapsed time, and step counts from
  the same row snapshot as the primary agents list, eliminating contradictory
  worker state between the two surfaces.

- Composer submission and its hints now share one state machine. Portable
  terminals use Enter to queue during a running turn and Enter again to steer;
  Ctrl/Cmd+Enter is accepted only when an enhanced terminal reports it and is
  no longer advertised as universally available.

- `edit_file` now matches LF-only model search text against CRLF files,
  preserves the file's line-ending style for replacement text, and still
  rejects newline-normalized duplicate matches as non-unique (#4764).
  Implemented in PR #4942 by @nightt5879; reported and root-caused by

- `/fleet status` read the current TUI session's sub-agents while `codewhale
  fleet status` read the durable `.codewhale/fleet.jsonl` ledger — two different
  things wearing one name, so a run started by `codewhale fleet run` never
  appeared in the TUI. `/fleet status` now reads the durable ledger through the
  same code path as the CLI; the session view keeps its own name as
  `/fleet workers` (`/subagents` and `n` still work). When a workspace has no
  ledger, both surfaces report a typed `no_fleet_ledger` reason instead of an
  empty-looking "all clear", and neither creates the ledger as a side effect of
  reading it (#4022).

- `codewhale fleet status` (and `list`/`interrupt`/`resume`) created
  `.codewhale/fleet.jsonl` as a side effect of opening the manager, then
  reported `no_fleet_ledger` for the file it had just made — so the second
  invocation showed an empty Fleet where none existed. The CLI now refuses
  those verbs before the manager is constructed, matching `/fleet` (#4022).

- `fleet resume <run-id>` accepted any string. An id absent from the ledger
  reconciled nothing but still wrote a run-status record keyed by whatever was
  typed, and reported `no_change`. Unknown ids are now refused as `not_found`
  before any durable write (#4022).

- `lane interrupt` reported `transitioned` even when it changed nothing —
  another process's stop looked like our own. The Runtime backend now reports
  whether *this* call performed the transition, and a no-op is `no_change`.
  The `@<lifecycle-seq>` fence is also evaluated inside the registry's per-Lane
  lock rather than before it, so a stale fence refuses without running Runtime
  teardown instead of racing between the check and the stop (#1888).

- `/lane` no longer runs Runtime teardown on the TUI composer thread. Reads on
  the slash surface skip reconciliation (which probes tmux and takes a lock)
  and say so on the receipt instead of implying freshness; `lane interrupt` is
  CLI-only until that work runs off-thread, and reports
  `surface_not_supported` naming `codewhale lane interrupt` (#4022).

- The hotbar is no longer modelled as a third control surface. A slot binds a
  slash command and fires it with no argument, so it runs *as* the slash
  surface; the contract now declares which verb a bare press actually reaches
  (`hotbar_bare_dispatch`, true only for `lane.list`) instead of advertising
  target-taking verbs as hotbar-reachable (#1888).

- `codewhale lane list --json` and `lane status --json` keep emitting the
  `LaneRecord` shape they always have — the receipt did not replace it. The
  human `lane status` output also regained `branch`, `session`, `socket`,
  `attach`, and `log`, which the first cut of the shared DTO had dropped
  (#1888).

- No surface advertises a backend it does not have. `lane restart` and
  `lane resume` have no implementation — a Lane is re-created by
  `codewhale lane start`, and a stopped Lane's Runtime session is gone — so all
  three surfaces refuse them with `backend_not_implemented` and say why.
  `fleet restart` drives the manager loop to completion, which only the CLI
  runs, so `/fleet restart` reports `surface_not_supported` and names the CLI
  command rather than quietly doing a smaller thing (#1888).

- Deny rules in `permissions.toml` no longer miss a command because of an
  intervening flag: deny matching is token-based with flag-skipping and
  backtracking, so a `git push` rule still catches
  `git -c foo=bar push`. Path matching folds case only on platforms whose
  filesystems are case-insensitive, and the default approval branch no
  longer proposes the working directory as a network host.

- MCP tool calls run once. A failed call is no longer retried as if it
  were a failed lookup, qualified-name resolution collects every match and
  reports an ambiguity instead of taking whichever the hash map yielded
  first, and registering a server whose name collides with an existing one
  after sanitization is now an error rather than a silent overwrite.
  The equivalent call-once fix direction came from closed PR #4756 by
  @adity982.

- The session index survives a torn line: an unparseable entry is skipped
  rather than aborting the whole read, appends carry their data through to
  disk, and appends and compaction share a lock so a compaction can no
  longer race an append into a lost record.

- `Edit` counts as a write tool for workflow elevation, and the TUI's
  write/shell classification now delegates to one shared allowlist rather
  than keeping a second copy that could drift.

- A rejected `app/config/set` stays a no-op. Previously an invalid value
  still tore down the cached runtime bridge, killing the child runtime and
  orphaning every other in-flight stdio thread behind a response that
  correctly reported failure.

- A malformed project `config.toml` is no longer indistinguishable from
  having no project config. Because a project config may only *tighten*
  approval and sandbox policy, silently discarding a broken one dropped a
  repository's restrictions back to the looser user defaults; the setup
  wizard now says so, naming the file but never quoting its contents.

- An expired lane worktree no longer leaves its branch behind, which made
  reusing the same lane name fail with "branch already exists". A branch
  still carrying unmerged commits is kept — a TTL lapsing is not consent
  to delete someone's work.

- An in-flight `thread/message` turn can be stopped. The stdio loop keeps
  reading while a turn streams, so the new `thread/interrupt` request (and
  `shutdown`) can reach a runaway turn instead of waiting on the very turn
  they were meant to stop.

- Precedence is stated only in the constitution's "Whose word wins" section.
  Memory hygiene no longer ships an inverted Tier list that put the
  constitution above the user's current request; approval, compaction, and
  personality overlays describe behavior without rank vocabulary; and the
  authority recap points at the single source rather than restating a second
  ladder.

- `<turn_meta>` carries facts (mode, posture, model, workspace), not mode
  doctrine or permission-question essays re-asserted every user message.

- The project context pack (pretty-printed workspace tree) is off by default
  and opt-in via `[context] project_pack = true`. Language law is compressed
  while keeping the English-constitution / user-language-reply contract.

- Modal lists and config pickers wrap selection at both ends (Down past the
  last row returns to the top). Home-directory resolution prefers
  `HOME`/`USERPROFILE` via `effective_home_dir` across remaining call sites so
  Windows tests that fake the home env vars match production paths. The
  equivalent home-directory sweep came from closed PR #4760 by
  @EvanProgramming.

### Changed

- Prefix-cache tool catalog entries store only the SHA-256 digest, not the
  joined catalog string. Unused plan-transition validation helpers are removed.

- Settings sections now hold only what they claim (#4751). Fleet keeps
  Fleet/member concerns; `/goal` moved to a **Session** section and Workflow
  orchestration to its own **Workflow** section. The inert DeepSeek-only
  `default_model` fallback moved out of Model settings into an explicit
  **Legacy** section — exact-Fleet users switch Fleets, not fallback models;
  the config field is retained because the runtime still reads it. This is
  presentation only: the persisted keys (`goal_command`, `workflow`,
  `default_model`), their values, scopes, and runtime behavior are unchanged.

- Auto model routing is scoped to the active provider. The classifier
  inventory no longer discloses other providers' runnable routes (or the fact
  that their credentials exist), a classifier reply naming another provider is
  refused, the local heuristic no longer falls back to a different provider
  when the active one is unusable, and the implicit DeepSeek-flash classifier
  is skipped for non-DeepSeek sessions. Auto receipts and the model picker
  hint report the active-provider-only scope instead of "runnable providers".
  Cross-provider Auto is available only through the persisted `[auto]
  cross_provider = true` opt-in (an explicit `[auto.router]` route remains its
  own opt-in for the classifier call). Same-provider strong/fast selection and
  `[auto] cost_saving` are unchanged.

- The QA pseudo-terminal acceptance harness now parses frames with `rio-vt`
  behind its existing neutral frame/color surface, retaining the assertions
  while removing the `vt100` dependency (PR #4931 by @raphamorim).

- Anthropic Messages and OpenAI Responses stream opening now share the
  `client/stream_entry.rs` seam already used by Chat Completions: one bounded
  response-header wait, shared dual/HTTP-1.1 policy selection, at most one
  HTTP/1.1 fallback on a classified HTTP/2 header stall, and common idle-timeout
  diagnostics. Wire-specific authentication, headers, endpoints, decoding, and
  rate-limit behavior remain at each adapter edge. The timeout-placement
  diagnosis and fix direction came from closed PR #4743 by
  @vibecoding-skills.

### Security

- Release containers now publish an SBOM attestation and pin maximum-mode
  provenance explicitly so supply-chain metadata cannot silently weaken with a
  builder-default change (PR #4958 by @kobihikri).

## [0.9.1] - 2026-07-24

### Dogfood follow-ups (2026-07-24)

### Added

- `/compact [focus]`: the manual compaction command now accepts an
  optional focus argument that is injected into the summary prompt, and
  the compaction summary itself becomes a structured nine-section
  successor briefing (primary intent, key concepts, files and code,
  errors and fixes, problem solving, user messages, pending tasks,
  current work, next step) that carries earlier compaction summaries
  forward and explicitly forbids tool use — replacing the free-form
  "under N words" instruction. Codewhale's pin/working-set and
  V4 prefix-cache-aligned machinery are unchanged.

- Saved workflows become slash commands: `*.workflow.js` files under
  `<workspace>/.codewhale/workflows/` and `~/.codewhale/workflows/` are
  discovered as `/name` commands that accept custom arguments (forwarded
  to the run's `args`), launch through the `workflow` tool in the
  background, and report their run id. Hand-written `.md` commands with
  the same name always win. The workflow tool's `source_path` now also
  accepts the user-global `~/.codewhale/workflows/` store, and every
  settled run leaves a durable synthesized report under
  `.codewhale/reports/<run_id>.md` (status, goal, gates, progress,
  result, verification).

### Fixed

- Disambiguate the two Kimi K3 model-picker rows, which read as an
  unexplained duplicate: bare `k3` is now labeled "Kimi Code plan route"
  with its default 262K window annotated as the plan-tier floor (raisable
  via the provider `context_window` setting for plans that include 1M),
  and `kimi-k3` is labeled "Moonshot direct route" with its 1M window.
  Both remain distinct, valid routes for the same underlying model.
- Close the model-facing `agent` tool role schema: the `type` property now
  publishes the canonical JSON Schema enum `["worker", "scout", "planner",
  "reviewer", "builder", "verifier", "custom"]` instead of describing the
  accepted values in prose. Legacy aliases are no longer advertised to
  models; they remain accepted only at replay/deserialization boundaries.
  Provider schema sanitizers (Chat Completions, strict mode, Anthropic
  Messages / OpenAI Responses, Moonshot/Kimi) are pinned by test to
  preserve the closed enum.

### Changed

- Rework the ambient idle ocean: the water now holds exactly one loose
  wedge school of fish, jellyfish, bubbles, and the rare whale cameo —
  seaweed and bio-dust are removed. Fish swim on a wrap-around path and
  always face the way they move (direction can only change while the
  school is off-screen); the lead fish carries an eye (`><o>`).
  Jellyfish become a pulsing bell with a lagging swaying tentacle. All
  ambient marks now glow via background→ink color lerp: a travelling
  sin² wave through the school, a floor-bounded pulse for jellyfish,
  and occasional raised-cosine glints on bubbles, with deliberately
  non-matching periods so nothing strobes in sync.

- Rename the internal delegated-worker role type from `SubAgentType` to
  `FleetRole` with canonical variants (`Worker`, `Scout`, `Planner`,
  `Reviewer`, `Builder`, `Verifier`, `Custom`) matching the public Fleet
  vocabulary one-to-one. Wire behavior is unchanged: serialization emits
  canonical Fleet values only, and persisted `agent_type` fields plus
  documented legacy spellings (`general`, `explore`, `plan`, `review`,
  `implementer`, …) continue to load at deserialization/parse boundaries;
  unknown role tokens still fail closed with the canonical vocabulary in
  the error.


The Codewhale v0.9.1 source candidate includes a first-class local web client over the Runtime API,
first-class OpenCode Go and TelecomJS TokenHub providers and restored xAI device login,
calendar-correct hourly automations, a buildable OpenHarmony workflow-js
target, and hardening for Auto routing, remote-terminal clipboard transport,
restart recovery, and a coherent TUI, Work, evidence, and public release
surface.

### Added

- Add `codewhale web [--port 7878]`, a first-class loopback-only browser
  client over the canonical Runtime API. The dependency-free embedded shell
  supports thread lifecycle, snapshot-then-SSE transcripts, turn start/steer/
  interrupt, approvals, and user questions, including pending-request recovery
  across tab reloads, while leaving unsupported managed,
  files, PTY, model-selection, and Fleet controls absent. Browser auth uses a
  short-lived one-time loopback capability exchanged for an opaque, bounded,
  process-local HttpOnly, SameSite=Strict session cookie with a same-origin
  mutation guard; Runtime tokens never enter URLs, HTML, browser storage, logs,
  or browser-launch arguments (#4423).
- Add OpenCode Go as a first-class, subscription-backed Chat Completions
  provider with `[providers.opencode_go]`, `OPENCODE_GO_API_KEY`, and the eight
  models currently documented on its `/v1/chat/completions` endpoint. Models
  served only through OpenCode Go's Anthropic `/messages` endpoint remain out
  of this narrow route until Codewhale supports per-model wire selection
  (#1481 by @seanthefuturegorilla; implementation harvested from PR #773 by
  @zhangweiii and PR #1050 by @sternelee).
- Add TelecomJS TokenHub as a first-class Chat Completions provider with
  `[providers.telecomjs]`, `TELECOMJS_API_KEY`, and a key-scoped live
  `/v1/models` refresh. Models.dev and provider-specific catalogs remain in
  separate source partitions so either refresh order preserves both; refreshes
  do not delete the other source's rows, matching model ids from unrelated
  providers do not fabricate metadata, and chat requests omit unsupported
  reasoning fields (PR #4370 by @baendlorel; harvested with co-authorship).
- Prepare native Windows ARM64 `codewhale`, `codew`, and `codewhale-tui`
  binaries, npm selection, updater support, and standard/portable release
  archives. Build and smoke them on GitHub's native Windows 11 ARM runner,
  and move Linux ARM64 release builds to the native Ubuntu ARM runner to
  remove the slower multi-arch cross-link setup (#4267 by @w1w218).
- `load_skill` tool now supports listing: omit `name` or pass `"list"` to
  see all available skills without loading one (#4651).
- Add a unified `/skills` manager with one precedence-aware root catalog,
  bounded duplicate/shadow/conflict auditing, package provenance, and
  validated install, update, remove, and trust mutations (PR #4679 by
  @SamhandsomeLee).
- Add a safe Agent Details view and bounded, structured `current_activity` to
  the single Work projection, sourced from worker events instead of renderer
  string inference. Rows stay compact, exact evidence is opt-in, and raw child
  output never enters the parent transcript (#2889 and #4636; design direction
  by @aboimpinto, preserved from #2694).
- Make exact results and delegated coordination durable: non-inline tool output
  becomes immutable session-owned evidence behind bounded receipts; File
  mutations add configurable success-only diffs; and decisions and write
  contention survive restart with typed neutral-fan-in records (#4619, #4636,
  #4647).
- Runtime API provider registry and atomic provider-switch endpoints
  (`GET /v1/providers`, `GET /v1/providers/{id}/models`,
  `POST /v1/providers/{id}/switch`) so the web GUI renders a dynamic
  provider/model picker without the setConfig+reload clobber (#4658).
- Typed filter (`/`) in the Fleet setup wizard's Model step: substring
  match over provider id, display label, and model id keeps
  OpenRouter-scale catalogs navigable (#4639).
- `[auto.router]` config: explicit provider/model/thinking for the Auto
  mode classifier route; unset keeps the DeepSeek flash default, and
  missing credentials fall back to the local heuristic.

### Changed

- Keep the top activity bar literal and actionable: active To-dos appear first,
  followed by Sub-agents, while generic operations and coordination stay in
  the detail surface. Completed-only bars auto-hide, and top/side layouts can
  be resized by dragging their divider and retain the chosen size (#4700,
  #4702).
- Use each theme's semantic colors for composer mode and permission rails, and
  show a larger inline reasoning preview with clearer local/full expansion
  affordances (#4699, #4701).
- Simplify the model-facing runtime around stable action tools (`File`, `Git`,
  `Run`, deferred `Web`, and durable task and automation families), with legacy
  spellings hidden for replay. Fresh sessions no longer reserve a Work surface
  before real work exists (PR #4675).
- Give the terminal shell one deliberate visual language: cool Plan → Act →
  Operate and warm Ask → Auto-Review → Full Access ramps match between header
  and split composer edges; transcript rhythm groups related activity; a
  refined whale keeps the empty state calm; and one-cell live motion with
  truthful labels distinguishes reasoning, reading, tool use, and verification
  without exposing private reasoning text. Reduced-motion and animation-off
  settings freeze it, while ASCII-safe terminals retain the signal (#4676,
  #4677).
- Unified shell tool: the model now sees a single `Bash` tool with an `action`
  parameter (run/wait/interact/cancel). Legacy `exec_shell*` names remain as
  hidden compat aliases for transcript replay, and the tool-search catalog
  keeps `Bash` active by default (#4625).
- Tool output inline preview increased from 6 to 12 lines (4 head + 4 tail)
  before the fold indicator; full pager (`v` key) unchanged (#4603).
- Mode changes (`/mode agent|plan|operate`) now persist to `settings.toml`
  and restore across sessions (#4628).
- Billing provenance: every outgoing API request carries an
  `x-codewhale-provenance` header with client version and provider (#4324).
- The `/model` picker's typed search now ranks results: provider-name
  matches first (drill-down), then exact id, then id-prefix, then the
  active provider's rows (#4639).
- System prompt text consolidated into a single `prompts/text.rs`
  module (byte-exact constants replacing 17 layered files);
  composition order, constitution-first binding, and locale/personality
  variants unchanged.
- Ask, Auto-Review, Full Access, and Never resolve through one permission
  contract: `resolve_tool_permission` in the engine and
  `resolve_approval_request_disposition` in the UI share one truth table for
  session grants/denials, non-bypassable policy holds, and modal prompts
  (#4412).
- Collapsed multi-struct tool families into single action-dispatched tools
  (`AutomationTool`, `TasksTool`, `GithubTool`, `RlmTool`) while keeping
  legacy tool names as hidden compatibility aliases for transcript replay.
- Operate-mode children default to leaf depth (`max_depth=0`) unless the
  caller explicitly grants a deeper budget (#4598).

### Fixed

- Restore `uwu` theme config round-tripping and keep header permission colors
  and authored idle-whale geometry aligned with the selected theme (#4696).
- Default canonical `Bash` runs with no explicit `cwd` to the active
  `ToolContext.workspace`, including an isolated sub-agent worktree, instead of
  falling through to the shared shell manager's parent workspace. The regression
  test detects the selected workspace through marker files so it remains
  meaningful across PowerShell path spellings (#4674, PR #4673 by @fleitz).
- Generate QuickJS bindings for `aarch64-unknown-linux-ohos` with the native
  SDK's libclang and sysroot, carry the OHOS target and sysroot through final
  linking, and keep unsupported persistent PTY dependencies out of the target
  while retaining non-PTY `exec_shell` support (#4470 by @shenjackyuanjie;
  original bindgen approach in #4384 by @shenyongqing).
- Honor `[auto] cost_saving = true` in provider-aware heuristic and classifier
  routing, using only validated same-provider fast siblings and deriving
  fallback candidates from their actual provider so Auto cannot invent a
  cross-provider model. Providers without a known fast sibling stay on the
  active model (#4486; partial #4405).
- Make terminal-client clipboard behavior truthful over SSH: use OSC 52
  outside tmux, stock `tmux load-buffer -w` inside tmux, and bracketed paste
  for client-to-remote text. Graphical text and image access now requires
  credible forwarding or an explicit override, transport failures no longer
  claim success, and help distinguishes terminal text paste from graphical
  image attachment (#4484).
- Keep a fresh TUI Work surface from rendering prior-session worker snapshots
  or durable-task terminal receipts whose creation or completion predates the
  current app start. Active durable tasks remain visible, and shared history
  stays available through `/tasks` and archived agent views (#4488; partial
  #4416).
- Make doctor and setup output distinguish static configuration, command
  availability, MCP protocol readiness, and backend health instead of
  presenting configured routes as live-healthy. Ordinary doctor runs no
  longer wake loopback/self-hosted providers unless `--probe-local` is
  explicitly requested (#4485; partial #4406).
- Serialize test-only configuration-path readers with temporary environment
  redirects so the Windows provider-persistence matrix cannot observe another
  test's transient `CODEWHALE_HOME` or config path (#4483, closing #4463).
- Restore direct Moonshot `kimi-k3` to its documented 1,048,576-token
  context window and 131,072-token output limit instead of treating the live
  model as an unknown legacy 128K route. The existing Kimi Code tiered `k3`
  route and credential reuse remain unchanged (#4481).
- Keep read-before-edit snapshots in the engine session so a file read remains
  valid across turns and context compaction, while a new session still starts
  with an empty tracker (#4475 by @Angel-Hair).
- Make `apply_patch` expose the canonical `replace` operation while continuing
  to accept deprecated `changes` payloads through one validation path. Mixed
  patch, replace, and compatibility modes now fail before any write (#4476 by
  @Angel-Hair).
- Show the prompt-cache hit rate in the phase strip when the Cache status item
  is enabled, using overflow-safe rounded integer math and leaving compact or
  disabled status layouts unchanged (#4474 by @dmitri-0).
- Preserve Solarized Light's canonical Base3 (`#fdf6e3`) shell background
  instead of tinting it green-grey through the default underwater Ombre
  treatment, while retaining foreground ambient life (#4457 by
  @AiurArtanis; PR #4471 by @nightt5879).
- Register `/slop` and `/canzha` as compatibility aliases of `/debt`, while
  keeping user-command ownership truthful across dispatch, help, slash
  completion, alias copy, and typo suggestions (PR #4680 by @nightt5879).
- Fail closed on legacy Kimi CLI credential imports: remove Codewhale's
  hard-coded first-party-client impersonation and refresh request, never
  auto-enable or rewrite imported credentials, and label the compatibility
  route as a read-only imported token. An explicitly configured, still-valid
  access token remains usable until expiry; missing, malformed, and expired
  imports recover through the supported Kimi Code API-key route while
  first-class OAuth awaits Codewhale's own vendor registration (#4417,
  partially addressed).
- Restore xAI/Grok device-code OAuth login against the live xAI OIDC
  contract: discovery with issuer/endpoint validation and documented
  fallbacks, user-principal scope set, RFC 8628 `slow_down` backoff capped at
  code expiry, bounded, sanitized error reporting for denial, expiry, and
  malformed responses, and a shared blocking-worker boundary for both CLI and
  TUI login so reqwest's blocking client never creates or drops its private
  runtime inside Codewhale's Tokio runtime (#4410).
- Anchor `FREQ=HOURLY` automations with `BYHOUR`/`BYMINUTE` to persisted
  local-calendar slots so intervals keep their wall-clock phase across DST,
  restart, resume, RRULE updates, duplicate-slot recovery, and post-run
  advancement. Nonexistent clock slots are skipped and ambiguous slots run at
  their first occurrence (#4381 by @h3c-hexin).
- Give content-watch drafts canonical identities: the link and semantic-drift
  watchers now write and dedup through one canonical draft-storage key with
  deterministic hash-suffixed IDs, validate and bound model drift output
  before any KV writes, and show truthful admin draft labels, so unchanged
  findings dedup and changed findings re-draft instead of colliding (#4453).
- Make model-policy JSON repair consider object and array payloads in source
  order, matching nested delimiters across quoted strings and escapes and
  returning the earliest balanced candidate that parses, instead of letting
  an unmatched opening delimiter or object-first preference corrupt array
  payloads (#4430).
- Convert persisted sub-agent completion and still-running control events into
  concise, non-authoritative resume checkpoints, keeping their raw runtime
  envelopes, sentinels, and retry instructions out of restored model and TUI
  conversation state (#4409).
- Deliver failed, stopped, and stale sub-agent outcomes exactly once to the
  awaiting parent, lifecycle mailbox, and TUI before closing their runtime
  state. Restart now reconciles orphaned queued/model/tool-wait worker records
  to interrupted while preserving checkpoints, and cancelled workers no
  longer read as completed in the TUI (#4408).
- Give host applications a cancellation boundary for MCP OAuth login so a
  stalled or abandoned provider login no longer hangs the calling session
  (#4380).
- Avoid blocked reader joins after Windows process kills so terminated shell
  sessions cannot hang their readers (#4383).
- Give stdin-less observer hooks immediate EOF and contain timed-out hook
  process trees so descendants and pipe readers cannot leak after the parent
  shell exits (#4489 by @luismateusvargas).
- Preserve the full unsigned Windows PTY process status instead of collapsing
  every high-bit exception or NTSTATUS to `2147483647`, including decimal and
  hexadecimal diagnostic metadata for device retests (#4100 by
  @redjade75723).
- Keep the Hotbar Setup action list synchronized with keyboard focus when the
  selection moves beyond the visible rows, including Down past `/export`
  (#4418).
- Route Windows OpenHarmony Cargo links through the repository's target-aware
  clang launcher so the final Rust link keeps its target, sysroot, and MUSL
  flags, and extend the no-SDK release guard to protect that contract. This
  completes [@shenjackyuanjie](https://github.com/shenjackyuanjie)'s PR #4470
  setup alongside [@shenyongqing](https://github.com/shenyongqing)'s original
  bindgen approach in PR #4384.
- Reconcile the website roadmap with reality: the retired share-link
  direction is now an explicit non-goal, Workrooms is the considered
  direction, and the local web client appears as underway, in English and
  Chinese (#3418).
- System-prompt skills block and skill-load warnings no longer embed absolute
  home/workspace paths; entries render workspace-relative or `~/…` so the
  byte-stable prompt prefix never leaks private paths. A new invariant test
  guards absolute paths, API keys, and workspace paths in the prefix (#4632).
- Mode/permission baseline unit tests no longer read the developer's live
  `settings.toml`; they isolate config I/O to a temp directory (#4628).
- Enter no longer freezes the composer on send: dispatch splits into a
  sync prepare phase (instant history + spinner) and a spawned async
  phase (auto-route, preflight, engine send), with submits gated while
  a dispatch is in flight (#4605).
- Self-hosted routes keep explicit per-model output limits for unknown
  wire aliases instead of the generic 4K fallback (#4655 by @h3c-hexin;
  PR #4656).
- Chat Completions idle-timeout errors now include received-byte and
  timing telemetry, distinguishing prefill stalls from mid-stream
  stalls with truncated tool-call arguments (#4657 by @h3c-hexin).
- `set_config` provider writes now keep the in-memory route in step,
  so a following model write lands in the new provider's table instead
  of clobbering the previous provider's root default_text_model (#4658
  by @gaord, with a follow-up route-sync fix).

### Security

- Restrict cross-origin Runtime API browser preflights to the documented
  authentication and content headers, explicitly allowing `Authorization`
  instead of relying on a wildcard (#4454).

### Security

- Harden the public community-site boundary: scheduled review drafts now use
  one canonical freshness namespace, admin discard is restricted to validated
  draft objects, public feed requests cannot spend the server-held GitHub
  token, and maintainer login bodies are type- and size-bounded before parsing.

## [0.9.0] - 2026-07-16

Codewhale v0.9.0 replaces the default terminal shell with the underwater
interaction system, makes Operate message-first, and hardens the Fleet,
Workflow, routing, accounting, and release surfaces that support day-to-day
agent work. The release also expands localization and gives the public site a
quieter, docs-first community foundation. Its provider work replaces the old
hand-maintained picker boundary with live ProviderLake discovery and adds the
largest curated model-and-pricing expansion in the project so far.

### Fixed — final integration

- Redact configured, environment, file-backed, and bare active credentials
  from every tool result before it crosses any model-provider wire protocol;
  retrieved spillover content is sanitized again at that boundary. The
  `read_file` tool also refuses CodeWhale configuration, backup, and
  credential-store paths, preventing routine tool use from exposing those
  local files.
- Keep immediate TUI submit failures inside the shell: custom-provider route
  preflight and closed-mailbox errors now restore the exact composer draft and
  selected skill for retry, with a sticky visible error instead of exiting.
- Anchor automatic compaction thresholds to the route's spendable input
  budget after output reservation and safety headroom, so large-output and
  tight self-hosted routes compact before provider context rejection. The TUI
  pre-send gate and warning copy now use the same token threshold as the
  engine. Preserve the 262K Kimi route's usable input budget and use the
  documented 32K default generation budget instead of mirroring the context
  window as output (#4293 by @SamhandsomeLee, #4368 by @bruce6135, and #4378
  by @mvanhorn).
- Fail closed instead of reporting base-rate dollar estimates for direct OpenAI
  GPT-5.4/5.4 Pro, GPT-5.5 (including dated snapshots), and GPT-5.6
  Sol/Terra/Luna requests above 272K input tokens. Exact tiered accounting
  remains deferred to the generalized pricing schema; smaller 5.4 variants,
  GPT-5.5 Pro, Codex subscription, and foreign-provider routes are unchanged
  (#4317).
- Retire `deepseek-chat` and `deepseek-reasoner` before they reach DeepSeek's
  first-party OpenAI or Anthropic wire APIs, migrating both to the documented
  `deepseek-v4-flash` replacement while preserving legacy non-thinking /
  thinking intent when no explicit reasoning tier is set. Aggregator, Wanjie
  Ark, self-hosted, and custom endpoint model ids remain provider-owned (#4320).
- Make Operate a message-first multitask surface: ordinary prompts work without
  a Workflow, direct parent tools follow the same approval, sandbox, shell,
  ask-rule, and repository protections as Act, and follow-ups can queue while
  work is active. Bounded background workers remain preferred for independent,
  parallel, isolated, or long-running work; child handoffs cannot inherit
  standing Full Access, and each dispatch produces one durable completion
  receipt.
- Let personal Fleet profiles in `CODEWHALE_HOME/agents` travel across
  repositories while project profiles in `.codewhale/agents` override them.
  Saving refreshes the live roster, and the UI now says explicitly that profile
  availability does not expand workspace, trust, or filesystem authority.
- Move file-mention discovery onto one bounded, generation-safe background
  worker so a slow filesystem read cannot freeze composer input. Exact paths
  resolve on send; fuzzy matches stay in the completion popup instead of
  silently attaching an arbitrary same-name file (#4365 by @WavesMan, with the
  initial bounded-walk approach from #4367 by @LeoLin990405).
- Keep the opt-in `remember` tool in the model-visible first-turn catalog so
  durable preference capture works without requiring a model to discover a
  tool it cannot yet know exists (#4373 by @Angel-Hair and #4377 by
  @mvanhorn).
- Make `review` handle a staged snapshot relative to a base ref by comparing
  the branch merge-base tree with the index. This preserves committed and
  staged branch work, excludes unstaged edits, and avoids the invalid
  `git diff --cached <base>...HEAD` form.
- Honor each MCP server's advertised discovery capabilities before calling
  optional tools, resources, templates, or prompts; keep optional probes
  independently bounded and fail-soft (#4308 by @nsfoxer).
- Make offline `scorecard` pricing provider-aware: `turn_end` records carry the
  effective route and a non-secret billing surface, runtime exports and
  supported aliases ingest cleanly, legacy/unknown routes remain explicitly
  unpriced, and route-scoped cache and recorded-time pricing replace model-only
  guesses. Historical runtime aggregates use each turn's recorded time;
  costless catalog routes fail closed while exact provider-owned hand-price
  rows remain available. StepFun PAYG and Step Plan usage now stay distinct
  without persisting raw endpoint URLs, so subscription quota is never reported
  as token spend (#4335). Completion-only shell, manual-compaction, and purge
  events remain visible to `turn_end` observers as explicitly non-model
  lifecycle records. This builds on the scorecard introduced by @findshan in
  #3388.
- Preserve named custom-provider identity across TUI sessions, `exec --resume`,
  runtime threads, exports, cache and Workflow receipts. Restores resolve the
  saved provider against live configuration before creating a client, never
  infer a provider from the model ID, and fail closed when the named route was
  removed, invalid, or ambiguous (#4334).
- Bind credentials to the endpoint that owns them. Environment-selected custom
  hosts can no longer inherit saved provider keys, keyring entries, OAuth, or
  ambient provider variables; only an explicitly source-marked CLI key may
  follow an explicit CLI endpoint override. `auth_mode = "none"` also strips
  credential-shaped custom headers consistently in the TUI and app server,
  while keyless loopback routes remain usable as local runtimes.
- Make hosted runtime threads deterministic and provider-exact: serialize
  thread, turn, and event mutation; keep cancellation ownership with the host;
  preserve the selected provider through every durable turn; terminalize
  exceptional streams once; and prevent the runtime manager from silently
  dispatching unclaimed goal continuations or child turns.
- Treat required user confirmation as a real goal blocker instead of a failed
  goal, and explain how to recover when a previously cached approval is denied.
  Cached-denial recovery is also committed as a settled transcript receipt, so
  tool completion or a later status update cannot erase it from scrollback or
  accessibility output. The notice now describes matching, process-scoped
  denials truthfully across all shipped locales; approval audits honor
  `CODEWHALE_HOME`, and expired status toasts cannot remain trapped behind a
  persistent entry. Both states remain visible and actionable instead of
  looking like unexplained model or tool failure (#4374 and #4375 by
  @Angel-Hair, with the final hardening in #4385 by @nightt5879).
- Make Fleet launch and teardown deterministic: route flags are placed before
  `exec`, workers are contained in owned Unix sessions or Windows Job Objects,
  and cancellation reaps surviving descendants with bounded escalation before
  manager state settles. Fence progress, terminal status, verification
  receipts, and evidence by durable attempt generation so a stale process can
  never complete or overwrite a restarted attempt; terminal state and receipt
  now commit atomically, stale-heartbeat decisions use a full lease CAS,
  exhausted-retry alerts are exactly once, and crash-truncated ledger tails are
  quarantined before the next append. Standalone CLI and Runtime API restart
  controls now drive the replacement attempt through a real executor to its
  terminal receipt, while per-run manager ownership prevents concurrent
  controllers from launching the same attempt twice.
- Keep the stopship Workflow fixture bounded to measured 24k-per-turn role
  budgets and a 360k aggregate. Authored child step and wall-time limits now
  reach the live runtime, including launch-queue wait; promoted evidence stays
  intact between roles, tool-free handoff consumers omit tool fields on the
  provider wire, and a terminal `BLOCK` fails the Workflow instead of producing
  a successful Lane receipt. Free-form descriptions no longer fabricate write,
  shell, or network risk; unknown structured risk remains fail-closed.
- Keep repository trust affirmative and explicit: only `1`/`Y` are advertised
  as acceptance keys, while Enter remains non-affirmative and explains the
  required choice.
- Replace literal legal and doctrinal metaphors in Simplified Chinese setup and
  `/constitution` copy with direct collaboration terminology reviewed by a
  native speaker (#4369 by @hmr-BH).
- Keep the transcript reviewable while an inline approval card is active:
  Page Up/Down, modified arrows, Home/End, and the mouse wheel now move through
  the visible evidence without changing or dismissing the pending decision
  (#4371 by @amuthantamil).
- Match generated worker names to the active UI language while preserving
  explicit user names, and tighten the 89x50 shell rhythm across Fleet rows,
  choice dialogs, transcript boundaries, and the idle composer.
- Put docs content and search before the full index on small screens, reduce
  mobile dead space, and keep the public community copy focused on issues,
  pull requests, and international contributors.

### Changed — the underwater shell

- Replace the default TUI shell with the underwater interaction system: one
  renderer owns the header, top work strip, transcript ledger, composer, and
  footer, with explicit compact/normal/wide tiers and no legacy sidebar or
  dashboard in the default path. The legacy composition survives only behind
  the internal `classic` treatment.
- Add a distinct pre-session launch screen — new session, new worktree (with
  inline naming and real lane provisioning), scoped resume count, changelog,
  quit — with reliable non-colliding keys and row/keyboard parity.
- Render turns as a ledger: user message, short narration, settled tool
  receipts, and exactly one live row. Fast tool bursts land directly as
  batch receipts (no spinner churn), completed receipts stay inspectable,
  failures hold a coral receipt with stderr one `v` away, and one shared
  tool rail replaces nested card borders.
- Make completion a one-shot exhale: `working -> finishing -> done` in the
  footer only, with no transcript repaint, no lingering loop, and no stale
  cancel action in the completed state.
- Rebuild the secondary rooms on one hairline grammar — config, setup,
  sessions, help, context, theme, model/route, Fleet, file attach — each
  with a title hairline, row objects with focus/selection/mouse parity,
  one panel-owned scroll rail, and wrapped action footers.
- Make `/model` a model-first atomic route picker across configured
  providers: provider and model switch together on apply, and every row
  prints the resolved model. `/theme` gains a live preview with truthful
  Esc revert across all 12 shipped themes.
- Add a live context inspector (Alt+C) backed by the current route: exact
  system/messages/free token buckets, a proportional map, drill-down into
  the detail pager, and no frozen session while it is open.
- Project Workflow runs as an in-stream run map: a collapsed one-line card
  that unfolds into per-lane rows with role, resolved model, worktree,
  elapsed track, and per-member running/waiting/failed/cancelled/done
  states, plus gates and a debrief built only from real run data. Child
  transcripts never flood the parent shell.
- Unify Fleet into roster/setup/workers rooms: the operator is pinned first
  with the live session route, members show resolved route truth (inherit /
  fast lane / pinned), and the workers tab is a control surface with
  row-local open/stop and real lifecycle counts.
- Distinguish repository-law approvals from ordinary approvals: the
  constitution prompt names its authority, source, matched rule, and target,
  and Full Access never bypasses it. Ordinary approvals render as a still
  coral band above the visible transcript.
- Keep streaming honest and cheap: provider-unit deltas replace per-grapheme
  queueing, the transcript is top-anchored so appended lines stop shifting
  settled rows, ambient animation stops during real work, and ordinary
  completion no longer triggers full-screen clears (verified by render-diff
  logs: suffix updates of tens of cells while streaming, zero periodic
  full repaints).
- Give every underwater treatment ambient life: ombre breathes its water
  column while flat and Terminal-owned keep the idle fish and bubble
  (foreground-only for Terminal), a typed treatment setting replaces string
  comparisons, reduced motion freezes life legibly, `fancy_animations =
  false` stills the chrome, and typing scatters the fish immediately. Fish
  keep a one-cell gap from occupied text; the whale remains the single brand
  mark and returns to stillness between caustic sweeps.
- Bring the whale mark to life with a soft diagonal caustic sweep, then let it
  genuinely rest. Active markers now share a smoother 8 Hz clock after the
  existing earned-motion delay, while reduced motion, hidden/off-screen views,
  modal ownership, and compact-terminal redraw budgets remain authoritative.
  The motion is adapted from the Apache-2.0 Grok Build interaction language,
  not copied as a global pulse or high-frequency receipt cascade.
- Keep compact terminals operable: `/config` and `/resume` collapse
  secondary chrome before sacrificing their selectable rows at 40x12 and
  60x16, bodies budget for the footer's real wrapped height, and the
  selection stays visible through resizes.
- Route footer notices through the classified toast system so informational
  acknowledgements (for example "Auto-compaction enabled") expire instead of
  becoming permanent idle chrome, while warnings and errors hold as sticky
  notices until their window passes.
- Complete the `CODEWHALE_ASCII_SAFE=1` decorative tier: the whale mark,
  context meter, braille state markers (mapped by dot density so the working
  bubble still reads as a rising fill), bubbles, rails, and role/lane glyphs
  all narrow to semantic ASCII while user, model, and CJK text passes
  through untouched. Verified by whole-surface rendered-buffer sweeps.
- Repair the Help catalog to match handler truth (`Alt+G`, `Alt+Shift+G`,
  `Alt+[`, `Alt+]`, `Alt+L`, `Alt+?`), and give theme, Help, model, and
  config rows direct mouse paths with the same activation as Enter.

### Changed — integrated runtime and TUI

- Make worker delegation route-aware and identity-safe: workers receive a
  small role-scoped system prompt instead of stale parent/model boilerplate,
  faster routes resolve through the configured provider, and opening a worker
  shows its complete available transcript. Remove `token_budget` from the
  ordinary model-facing Agent schema so agents do not micromanage ad-hoc
  launches; explicit legacy calls remain readable for compatibility.
- Mature `/config` interaction for enumerated and boolean settings with
  pickers/toggles, mouse-wheel scrolling, stable focus, and configured-provider
  selection. Startup mode is now only Agent or Plan; legacy `operate`/`yolo`
  settings migrate to Agent with permission posture represented separately.
- Show where effective permission policy comes from and keep profile,
  environment, project, managed, and requirements-controlled posture read-only
  in the in-session editor. Runtime presets edit only proven user-owned root
  settings and no longer persist temporary environment overlays.
- Restore the original four-line whale mark and make ambient ocean motion
  coherent across the full scroll surface: one continuous ombre, eased fish
  that face their direction of travel, fish in otherwise blank scrollback, and
  explicit reduced-motion and animation controls.
- Keep model reasoning in the transcript rather than the Tasks strip, retain
  the live header status indicator, separate worker and success colors, and use
  the same rail grammar for both work-strip and transcript scrollbars.
- Present the default Z.AI Coding Plan route, including child routes, as
  subscription quota instead of estimated per-token dollars. No undocumented
  account endpoint is called by this change.

### Added

- Thinking Machines Lab's Inkling through Together using the exact wire model
  `thinkingmachines/inkling`, with `inkling` and `together-inkling` aliases and
  exact `none` / `minimal` / `low` / `medium` / `high` / `max` reasoning
  values. Codewhale does not invent a context window, price, or offline picker
  claim while the provider's public catalog metadata remains inconsistent.
- Expand the verified offline catalog with Claude Sonnet 5, Claude Fable 5,
  GPT-5.3 Codex, and Qwen3.7 Plus, including time-aware Sonnet 5 introductory
  pricing and explicit cache rates. Refresh stale GLM-5.1, Kimi K2.6, Trinity,
  Qwen3.6, Nemotron, Anthropic, GLM-5.2, Kimi K2.7 Code, GLM-5 Turbo, and
  GPT-5 Codex price or limit rows; keep Xiaomi MiMo explicitly unpriced where
  the provider's token plan and pay-as-you-go surfaces cannot be distinguished.
- MiniMax Messages provider support for MiniMax-M3 and MiniMax-M2.7, with
  OpenAI-compatible and Messages routes, regional endpoint guidance, request
  coverage, catalog limits, and tier-aware pricing (PR #4354 by @octo-patch).
- Dynamic MCP server infrastructure and an approval-gated tool that lets the
  model start a configured MCP server from chat context. Harvested from
  #3869 and #3866 by @bistack with authorship preserved.
- Parent `--disallowed-tools` restrictions now flow into sub-agents and Fleet
  workers by default, including deny-wins, wildcard, catalog-filtering, and
  multi-generation inheritance coverage. Harvested from #4096 by @JayBeest
  (#4042).
- Korean (ko) UI locale with full key parity and onboarding/setup wiring
  (PR #4347 by @moduvoice).
- Localize the entire underwater layer: 104 new UI strings — launch menu,
  phase words, mode/permission chips, footer hints, session picker, context
  inspector, route and theme pickers, Fleet roster, workflow status, sidebar
  work strip, repository-law approval copy, and file-attach titles — wired
  through MessageIds and translated into ja, zh-Hans, es-419, pt-BR, vi,
  and ko. Every complete pack now holds exact raw key parity with English
  (856 keys), enforced by new tests that the old English-fallback gate could
  not perform. The permission chip maps from typed state, so localization
  can never silently collapse it. Machine-authored translations follow each
  pack's existing terminology and are flagged for native review.
- Anthropic adapter: sanitize top-level `oneOf`/`anyOf`/`allOf` in tool
  input schemas so affected tools no longer fail the whole request with
  HTTP 400 (PR #4346 by @qinlinwang).
- Anthropic pricing: bill cache-write tokens at published rates
  (PR #4348 by @knqiufan, #4318).
- NetBSD: generate QuickJS bindings at build time so `codewhale-workflow-js`
  compiles (PR #4349 by @ci4ic4).
- Real-PTY release gates for six-worker fan-out liveness with Esc cancel,
  multi-terminal route isolation, queued steering via terminal-safe Ctrl+G
  (with Ctrl+S retained where the terminal forwards it), the one-shot
  completion footer, and per-theme ANSI output for every shipped palette.

### Fixed

- Make release publication complete and source-anchored: every build checks out
  the resolved tag commit, tag movement is rejected before GHCR, GitHub
  Release, Homebrew, Cargo, or npm writes, and registry helpers require a clean
  checkout exactly matching the remote tag. Manual recovery runs are
  exact-tag-only and execute the same parity gate as automatic tag pushes.
- Publish a coherent distribution set: both checksum manifests now contain
  usable public basenames and cover the full 29-asset matrix; GHCR, Homebrew,
  GitHub archives, and the Linux x64 CNB mirror carry `codewhale`, `codew`, and
  `codewhale-tui`. The CNB shortcut now fails clearly outside Linux/OpenHarmony
  x64 instead of promising assets that the mirror does not build.
- Preserve task text when a skill is invoked through dollar, unified-slash, or
  explicit skill syntax, while keeping bare skill invocations and management
  subcommands intact (PR #4372 by @nightt5879, co-authored by @CCChisato;
  #3915).
- Honor MCP server discovery capabilities: require advertised or legacy
  `tools/list`, keep optional resource/template/prompt probes independently
  bounded and fail-soft, and format descriptions Unicode-safely (#4308,
  harvested with co-authorship from @nsfoxer).
- Age-evict terminal sub-agent worker records from the state ledger so
  long-lived, high-fan-out sessions do not keep rewriting multi-megabyte
  terminal history (#4217; root-cause and fix direction from @yekern).
- Resolve the sub-agent completion/cancellation race with one terminal-state
  claim: cancellation suppresses late mailbox/parent/UI delivery, while a
  completed result remains publicly running until its notification is safely
  delivered.
- Keep Workflow panel controls from stealing ordinary composer letters. Enter,
  Delete, Up/Down, and Esc own panel actions; typed characters return focus to
  the composer and start the message normally.
- Preserve the composer prompt gutter from the first typed character through
  wrapping, scrolling, cursor placement, and mouse hit-testing so the `>` does
  not disappear or make input appear to jump.
- Emit terminal-native OSC 8 metadata for rendered URLs without placing escape
  payload bytes in the measured text, keeping long links visible, selectable,
  and clickable in supporting terminals.

- Keep headless structured output terminal-clean: `codewhale exec` engines
  no longer emit interactive terminal-title/taskbar OSC sequences, so
  `--output-format stream-json` stdout stays parseable, escape-free JSONL.
  Interactive TUI sessions keep their terminal chrome.
- Localization honesty: the parity gate was blinded by its own English
  fallback — two keybinding rows (`KbCyclePermissions`, `KbCycleThinking`)
  were missing from all five "complete" packs and now ship translated; the
  Operate-mode copy that drifted in English was retranslated in every pack
  (including zh-Hant's slice); three MessageIds absent from
  ALL_MESSAGE_IDS are visible to tests again; and the `/config`
  theme/locale hints and the invalid-locale error derive from the shipped
  registries instead of stale hand lists that advertised 4 of 12 themes
  and 4 of 8 locales.
- The setup wizard's constitution step no longer claims a "55-line core"
  in any language (the bundled core is larger today); the guided draft says
  "the bundled core stays active" instead.
- In-app selection copy is rail-clean and now regression-tested: copied
  transcript text excludes the `▎ ╎ │ ●` decorations via cache metadata
  (#4208 — thanks @eugenicum for the report and code-aware fix direction;
  terminal-native selection with mouse capture off remains a product
  decision on the proposed `rail_style` option).

### Docs

- Stamp every 0.9-era roadmap document with an explicit status (current,
  historical, superseded, principle-only, or future RFC), correct trackers
  that recorded unshipped work as done, and describe what remains after
  v0.9.0 in `docs/AGENT_RUNTIME.md`.
- Add `docs/rfcs/UNIFIED_PROVIDER_LOGIN.md`: one `codewhale auth login`
  surface for Anthropic, OpenAI Codex, and xAI, with the Anthropic adapter
  gated on verifying flow permissions before any constants are adopted.
- Refresh `docs/ACCESSIBILITY.md` for treatment-independent ambient life
  and the completed ASCII tier.

### Changed — runtime foundations

- Make the advertised Android/Termux release target buildable by generating
  QuickJS bindings against the Android NDK instead of expecting an upstream
  pre-generated `aarch64-linux-android` binding file, and give Android CLI/TUI
  HTTP clients a preconfigured rustls root store (Mozilla WebPKI roots) so
  standalone Termux processes stop panicking inside
  `rustls-platform-verifier`'s JVM expectations (#4236, #4242).
- Rebalance the bundled Constitution after the v0.8.67 prompt ablation: keep
  the procedural policy tail in mode-specific layers, while restoring concise
  behavioral guidance for momentum, causal investigation, constraint-first
  decisions, mechanism-backed guarantees, and clean continuity.
- Wire live catalog cache into provider/model pickers without dropping stale or
  prior rows after TTL expiry / refresh failure (#4139). Remove the dead
  `OFFERING_SEEDS` hand table so the bundled Models.dev catalog is the sole
  seed source; pickers show a compact `stale` / `cache failed` chrome chip when
  the Models.dev layer is past TTL or last refresh failed.
- Make `work_update` the sole model-facing To-do / Work progress tool (#4132).
  `checklist_*` and `todo_*` remain registered as hidden compat aliases for
  transcript replay; `update_plan` stays Strategy metadata/context/route, not
  a second checklist. Mode/approval prompts nudge the single surface.
- Demote the bundled Models.dev snapshot to an offline/stale fallback after
  live catalog refresh (#4188). ProviderLake precedence is live Models.dev >
  bundled seed > legacy hardcoded completion names; pickers, inventory, and
  subagent validation stay catalog-backed, and Codewhale-only providers keep
  defaults when Models.dev has no rows.

### Added
- Wire xAI device-code OAuth into `codewhale auth xai-device`, the TUI
  `/auth xai-device` command, and guided provider setup, with comment-preserving
  auth-mode persistence and loopback exchange coverage (#4257).
- Add GPT-5.6 Sol, Terra, and Luna to the OpenAI API route, including their
  1.05M context metadata, 128K output limits, pricing, and `max` reasoning
  effort. Add Meta Model API as a first-class OpenAI-compatible provider for
  Muse Spark 1.1 with 1M context, tool/reasoning metadata, provider aliases,
  and both `META_MODEL_API_KEY` and Meta's `MODEL_API_KEY` credential names.
- Catalog automation: `scripts/catalog_models_dev.py` refreshes secret-free
  Models.dev / OpenRouter listings and validates the offline seed snapshot
  (`snapshot --check`) without ever persisting API keys (#4117).
- `/model` picker cycles six catalog views with `A` (Configured → Catalog →
  Recent → Coding → Cheap → Long context) and richer row metadata from the
  live/bundled catalog (context, max output, tools, reasoning, price/M,
  freshness). Discoverability views do not auto-apply a surprising route
  (#4115).

- Workflow runs are now durable: every run appends to a
  `.codewhale/workflow-runs.jsonl` journal and hydrates on startup, so
  `workflow status` survives restarts; runs left `running` by a dead process
  are recovered as failed (#4011). The transcript renders workflow tool
  output as a run card (status, goal, children, progress, verification)
  instead of a generic one-liner (#4038), and `workflow` accepts a `verify`
  flag that runs post-completion verification gates and fails the run when
  gates fail (#4013).
- Hotbar sources for MCP tools and skills: MCP tool slots prefill the
  composer (execution stays behind the normal tool-approval flow) and skill
  slots activate through the existing `$skill` alias (#2068, #2069).
- Mode & permission surface: Tab cycles Plan → Act → Operate; Shift+Tab
  cycles the Agent permission posture (Ask / Auto-Review / Full Access) with
  a footer permission chip; Ctrl+T cycles reasoning effort and Ctrl+Shift+T
  opens the live transcript overlay. Operate is the orchestration mode
  (delegate, wait, inspect, dispatch) and raises sub-agent fan-out while
  focusing the Agents sidebar.
- Provider lake facade: the provider/model pickers, hotbar, and model
  inventory now enumerate configured providers' models from the bundled
  catalog (with an `A` toggle to browse the full catalog), replacing the
  hardcoded per-provider model table (#3830 follow-up).
- Added Cursor-integrated-terminal dogfood evidence for the published v0.8.67
  release, covering installed binary provenance, release/publication checks,
  headless runtime smoke, setup QA, and remaining manual visual TUI checks.
- README and README.zh-CN now point users to the community-maintained
  CodeWhale for VS Code GUI frontend while clarifying that this repository's
  `extensions/vscode/` scaffold remains the read-only Phase 0 viewer (#4035).

### Fixed

- Sub-agent waiting no longer peek→sleep polls: `agent(action="wait")` joins
  children, unchanged peeks are throttled (~30s) with an anti-polling nudge,
  and mode prompts teach the join primitive (#4097). Harvested from PR #4098
  by [@Mr-Moon121](https://github.com/Mr-Moon121) (Jeffrey Luna).
- `/provider` picker remembers catalog/configured view and highlighted row
  across reopen, matching `/model` picker memory.
- Mode picker roster is exactly Act / Plan / Operate (no Multitask, no
  numeric `4`/`5` gaps). Legacy `yolo`/`4` remain invisible one-way
  permission shorthand for Act + Bypass.

- Fleet setup is a role/profile roster editor, not a provider-scoped model
  picker: the Model step lists routes from every configured provider (not
  only the active one), a picked route's provider is persisted explicitly in
  the saved profile TOML (`provider = "..."`, never inferred from the model
  id), and the loader/route resolver read that field back out verbatim. The
  draft-preview save keypress no longer competes with a separate pager's
  `g`/`G` scroll bindings — the exact TOML preview now renders inline on the
  same Review step that saves it (#4093).
- `codewhale fleet run` and interactive in-process Fleet launches now honor a
  profile-pinned provider/model route instead of merely recording it on the
  receipt. Headless workers receive the non-secret `--provider` and `--model`
  pair; TUI workers resolve the same explicit route in process. Credentials
  still come from the worker's environment, provider is never inferred from a
  model id, and unpinned workers continue to inherit the run route (#4093,
  #4193).
- The Fleet setup `m` model-assisted redraft no longer drops a picked
  cross-provider route: the provider/model the operator chose are re-pinned
  onto the drafted profile (a model draft is always `provider: None`), so
  saving it keeps the explicit route instead of persisting an ambiguous,
  provider-scoped profile (#4093).
- Saving a Fleet profile now fails with a clear message when it pins a
  provider that has no configured credentials, using the same
  configured-provider check the model picker uses (#4093).
- Workflow correctness: completion polling fails closed instead of
  fabricating success when a sub-agent reports no terminal status; cancel
  interrupts the JS VM (cancel handle + abort) and blocks further spawns;
  and `budget.spent()` reports real manager-scope usage instead of always 0.
- Sub-agent spawns validate the model↔provider pair before dispatch:
  inherited/faster routes remap foreign models to the provider's catalog
  default, and explicit pins fail fast with a diagnostic instead of an
  upstream model-not-found error.
- TUI stability: engine event drains break every 8–16 events / 8 ms to keep
  input live (#1830, #2317, #1198); the terminal input pump restarts after
  stall recovery on macOS/Linux too; the startup raw-mode probe no longer
  leaks raw mode on timeout; recovery snapshots persist every 45 s during
  long turns and the offline queue persists on every push (#1830);
  queue/steer paths surface toasts while streaming (#2317, #1338); and
  modal submit errors re-open the modal instead of being swallowed (#1198).
- Core/state: paused jobs persist as paused across restarts; unarchive
  updates the in-memory cache; tool dispatch has a timeout; MCP
  notifications no longer receive responses; corrupted checkpoints surface
  errors instead of loading empty state; the session index compacts instead
  of growing unbounded; and recording thread-goal usage no longer
  self-deadlocks the state store.
- Runtime compaction summaries are now persisted into `/v1` thread records so
  engine reloads and restarts preserve compacted context. Contributed by
  MXAntian (@MXAntian) (#4091).
- The TUI leaves xterm alternate-scroll mode off when mouse capture is disabled,
  preserving native terminal text selection in light-theme/no-mouse-capture
  sessions. Contributed by Nightt (@nightt5879) (#4088, #4026).
- The public `/api/github/feed` endpoint is now forced dynamic on Cloudflare so
  it returns live GitHub activity instead of a build-time empty feed.

### Security

- Require bearer authentication for `/v1/chat/completions`, compare tokens in
  constant time, return accurate 4xx/5xx statuses, bound request bodies and SSE
  frames, redact secrets from stdio `config get`, and reliably reap the runtime
  child during shutdown.
- Keep trust precedence and secret persistence fail-closed: user ExecPolicy
  rules outrank agent-layer rules, chained commands cannot propose unsafe
  trusted-prefix amendments, and config and secret writes are atomic with
  filesystem synchronization on every supported platform.

### Changed

- Tool-hang watchdog trimmed from 15 minutes to 10 (#1862); approval modal
  footer hints use a higher-contrast tier (#3380); status/mode copy is
  disclosed once across header, footer, cards, and sidebar instead of
  repeated per layer.
- Removed the unused `tui::whale_routes` taxonomy module and its tests.
  Contributed by Darrell Thomas (@DarrellThomas) (#4041, #3852).

### Deprecated

- YOLO mode: `--yolo`, `default_mode = "yolo"`, and the hotbar YOLO action
  now map to Act + Full Access permissions via a compatibility shim and
  show a one-shot deprecation notice. Removal is deferred beyond v0.9.0 so
  this release does not break existing scripts without a dedicated cutover.

- Google Gemini is its own backend (`/provider google`) on the official
  OpenAI-compatible route with thought-signature capture/replay and
  fail-closed replay for thinking models. Antigravity (`agy` 1.1.13) joins
  as a separate credential-plane provider: consent-gated read-only import
  of the official CLI's login with `ANTIGRAVITY_API_KEY`/`AGY_ADC_AUTH`
  precedence; requests fail closed until the cloud-code wire protocol is
  implemented.

### Removed

- Remove the deprecated `deepseek` and `deepseek-tui` binary shims in this
  breaking release. `codewhale`, `codew`, and `codewhale-tui` are the supported
  entry points; existing DeepSeek provider support and legacy config/session
  migration remain intact.

### Known issues

- Android/Termux arm64 remains a preview in v0.9.0. The target, asset wiring,
  updater selection, dependency graph, and source-build path have automated or
  static coverage, but shell/PTY/config/TUI startup and runtime behavior remain
  unverified on a real device (#4236, #4242). Do not use a GNU/Linux arm64
  archive in Termux.

  same Review step that ratifies it (#4093).
- The headless `codewhale fleet run` CLI now launches workers on their profile-pinned route, not just records it on the receipt: `codewhale exec` gains a non-secret `--provider` flag, and a worker whose profile pins provider B is dispatched with `--provider B --model <B's model>` even when the parent session is on provider A (credentials still resolve from the worker's own environment; provider is never inferred from the model id). Workers with no profile-bound provider are unchanged — no `--provider`, run-level model. The interactive TUI spawns roster members in-process and does not yet honor the pinned provider (it uses the session provider); that remainder is tracked in #4193 (#4093).
- The Fleet setup `m` model-assisted redraft no longer drops a picked
  cross-provider route: the provider/model the operator chose are re-pinned
  onto the drafted profile (a model draft is always `provider: None`), so

- app-server hardening: `/v1/chat/completions` requires the bearer token;
  errors return real 4xx/5xx statuses; request bodies and SSE frames are
  size-limited; stdio `config get` redacts secrets and stdio shutdown reaps
  the runtime child; graceful shutdown on SIGTERM/Ctrl+C; constant-time
  token comparison; dropping the runtime bridge no longer blocks the
  runtime.
- Policy/config/secrets: user-layer ExecPolicy rules outrank agent-layer

## [0.8.67] - 2026-07-06

### Added

- The model you select in `/model` is now the operator: fleet workers whose
  task spec and roster profile pin no model inherit the active session route
  instead of a hardcoded `auto` sentinel, matching the pinned operator row in
  `/fleet roster`. Task-level and profile model overrides still win, and
  route receipts record which source applied (`task.model`,
  `agent_profile.model`, or `run.model`).
- Added the `/workflow` command (aliases `/workflows`, `/wf`) as the user
  opt-in to workflow orchestration. Bare `/workflow` orchestrates the current
  work — the model synthesizes the objective from the conversation context;
  `/workflow <objective>` narrows the run; `/workflow status [run_id]` and
  `/workflow cancel <run_id>` relay typed run receipts without starting new
  runs.
- Bare `/goal` with no active goal now declares a goal from the conversation
  context via `create_goal` instead of printing usage; with an active goal it
  remains the status readout, and explicit `/goal <objective>` is unchanged.
- Added the constitution-first setup wizard: a unified `/setup` shell with
  resume, back navigation, and skip-retry state; provider/model readiness
  cards with a custom-provider form and provider-picker detail layout; a
  runtime posture card with preset application and project-override warnings;
  a setup verification report; and transactional setup persistence with
  secret redaction and rollback (#3402, #3403, #3404, #3405, #3406, #3410,
  #3411).
- Added a structured user-global constitution with a deterministic renderer,
  prompt-block injection, guided principle authoring with preview and preset
  save, and a `/constitution` manager command as the primary constitution
  management surface, with file state shown in setup and actions surfaced in
  diagnostics (#3793, #3806, #3811).
- Added model-assisted constitution and fleet-profile drafting behind an
  explicit ratify gate, with untrusted-draft provenance recorded so
  model-authored text is never applied silently. Updating users keep their
  existing constitution unchanged, and a localized constitution checkpoint is
  required after update (#3794).
- Added the Hotbar route editor v1 with route-switch slot actions and support
  for custom model routes, plus a configured-provider route manager for
  `/provider` and `/model` with a missing-auth handoff into provider key
  entry (#2066, #3830, #3831).
- Added auto-discovery of `.codewhale/rules/` and `.claude/rules/`
  directories as project context, with a total byte-budget cap on the
  assembled rules block. Contributed by maple (@yekern).
- Exposed `context_input_budget_for_route` from the engine so external
  integrations can reuse route budget math. Contributed by hexin
  (@h3c-hexin).
- Added GUI config persistence to the runtime API. Contributed by @gaord.
- Added a website localization matrix with a locale registry and drift
  checks. Harvested from #3763 by @idling11 (#3090).
- Added `doctor` detection of half-applied setup state, and startup milestone
  tracing for boot-performance diagnosis.
- Added a v0.8.67 computer-use dogfood prompt that covers the Cursor-terminal
  QA flow, headless gates, setup, sub-agent completion, Fleet, Workflow, model
  pricing, and release evidence collection.
- Fleet: local worker memory usage is now reported, including retained memory
  while a task is in Running status. Contributed by @cyq1017 (#3901).
- Website: community hub, constitution thesis page and constitution-centered
  homepage, models page generated from the provider registry, docs dark mode
  and full SEO metadata/sitemap coverage, terminal player for real
  constitution traces, and a live star badge and version.
- Added Meituan LongCat as a first-class OpenAI-compatible provider
  (`longcat`, with `long-cat`, `meituan-longcat`, and `meituan` aliases),
  `LONGCAT_API_KEY` discovery, the `LongCat-2.0` default model, provider
  picker wiring, model completions, provider docs, and web provider facts.
- Fleet: added per-provider setup cards (Persistence, Constitution, Hotbar,
  Tools/MCP, Remote Runtime) with a unified setup catalog and provider-specific
  credential links. Provider setup progress is persisted transactionally with
  rollback guards, Codex OAuth is kept out of provider key storage, and a
  headless QA contract verifies setup readiness across providers.
- Fleet: added Fleet starter profiles with role-aware loadouts (scout→Fast,
  manager→Inherit, etc.), `/fleet setup` profile-authoring wizard, Fleet
  effective-permission recording, and route intent-source tracking.
- Fleet: added 'operator' as a built-in Fleet roster member — the preferred
  helm Fleet slot for workflow coordination. Operator plans, routes, reviews
  outputs, and calls other Fleet slots as needed. This is a roster role, not a
  separate app mode. The full Operation/Operate-mode architecture is deferred
  to 0.9.0.
- Workflow: declarative workflows now run through the production driver, the
  workflow tool is wired to sub-agent dispatch, public Workflow surfaces are
  renamed, and typed workflow-run and status receipts are emitted for
  debugging and verification.
- Added provider-agnostic Fleet rosters and loadouts: provider-specific
  subagent limits, launch concurrency, and admission caps are derived from
  config without hardcoding any single provider.
- Added Workflow runtime foundations: the internal JS authoring/runtime crates
  compile and replay example workflows. 0.8.67 ships the `/workflow` opt-in,
  production-driver dispatch path, sub-agent task handoff, and typed run/status
  receipts; richer authoring UX and the full TUI run view remain tracked for
  v0.8.68 (#2974, #4038).

### Changed

- Clarified the Fleet coordination hierarchy and made roles carry real
  doctrine: the **operator** (the session's `/model` selection) runs the
  operation and assigns managers to workflows; a **manager** is the middle
  manager of exactly one workflow. The built-in **reviewer** is now explicitly
  adversarial (assume the change is broken, try to refute it), and the review
  sub-agent intro adopts the same framing. Built-in `manager`/`operator`/
  `reviewer` roster members now ship role `instructions` that flow into worker
  prompts on both the Fleet task-spec and agent/workflow `profile:` spawn
  paths; custom profiles override them via the same `instructions` field.
- Removed the decorative Fleet vocabulary that never routed differently:
  the `tool-heavy` slot and the `strong`/`balanced`/`deep-reasoning`/`code`/
  `review`/`tool-heavy` loadout tiers. `inherit` (the operator's route) and
  `fast` (the provider's faster class) remain; retired names in existing
  configs keep parsing (as custom labels) with identical auto routing, and
  the `/fleet setup` model-class step now offers only the real choices.
- Raised the default subagent concurrency for high-throughput fanout:
  `max_subagents` default 20 → 64 (config ceiling 128) and the queued+running
  admission cap 200 → 1024. Users on metered plans who want the old behavior
  can set `max_subagents = 20` in config.toml.
- Renamed the internal `whaleflow` subsystem to `workflow` across the
  workspace: the `codewhale-whaleflow`/`codewhale-whaleflow-js` crates become
  `codewhale-workflow`/`codewhale-workflow-js`, Rust identifiers and JS bridge
  symbols are renamed, the `CODEWHALE_WHALEFLOW_JS_*` environment variables
  become `CODEWHALE_WORKFLOW_JS_*`, and the authoring/RFC docs move to
  `WORKFLOW_AUTHORING.md` and `WORKFLOW_EXTERNAL_MEMORY.md`. Historical
  changelog and retro-ledger entries keep the old name as a record.
- Documented the Homebrew rollout strategy and added a distribution-channel
  check to the release checklist. Harvested from #3760 by @idling11 (#3489).
- Paused Linux RISC-V prebuilt release and nightly artifacts because
  `rquickjs-sys` 0.12.0 does not ship `riscv64gc-unknown-linux-gnu` bindings;
  installers, docs, and update paths now treat RISC-V as unsupported until
  upstream bindings or a bindgen-enabled build lands.
- Made the approval prompt calm, compact, and honest, and centered the
  first-run follow-up on the constitution; first-run onboarding now hands off
  into the setup wizard, and the language picker offers every shipped locale
  (#3929).
- Startup performance: boot janitors and store scans no longer block the
  first frame, `@mention` completion no longer re-walks the workspace per
  keystroke, and idle offline-queue clones and duplicate tool-output hashing
  were eliminated.
- Clarified the misleading "Ctrl+B backgrounds this command" shell wording
  (#3859) and the hotbar help shortcuts. Docs contribution by Chanhyo Jung
  (@roian6).
- Documented the enforced repo-law invariants, the constitution flow, and the
  `/fleet setup` profile-authoring wizard; aligned `permissions.toml` action
  docs. Docs contribution by @greyfreedom.
- Bumped web dependencies: wrangler 4.103.0 → 4.107.0, mermaid 11.15.0 →
  11.16.0, vitest 4.1.8 → 4.1.9 (@dependabot).
- Backfilled v0.8.67 regression coverage across sub-agent completion, budget
  exhaustion, delegate ordering, provider onboarding, setup scroll, model
  catalog pricing, Fleet routing, and Workflow gates (#4076).
- Split the large TUI debug command group and palette/theme internals into
  smaller modules without changing user-visible behavior (#4078, #4081).

### Fixed

- Fixed the goal sidebar elapsed timer so completed and blocked goals freeze
  their "completed in {elapsed}" readout instead of ticking forever. Goal state
  now records a `finished_at` instant that both sidebar render paths and the
  engine snapshot clamp elapsed against; `/goal resume` clears the freeze and
  the timer ticks again.
- Fixed paused goals silently un-freezing their sidebar timer: usage keeps
  accruing while paused, and the next goal snapshot used to clear the frozen
  instant. Paused goals now stay frozen until an explicit resume.
- Fixed durable `/goal` progress accounting so usage and continuation updates
  release the shared SQLite connection before re-reading the updated goal,
  unblocking resumed goal loops and full workspace release tests.
- Fixed a scheduled-automation race where deleting an automation while its
  run was being enqueued left the already-created task running untracked;
  the run record is now persisted unconditionally.
- Removed `panic = "abort"` from the release profile: it disabled unwinding
  and broke the panic supervision that keeps one failing tool call from
  taking down the whole session. The `lto`/`strip`/`codegen-units` size and
  speed tuning is unchanged.
- Fixed session save/load to persist and restore the active model provider
  across restarts. Previously sessions created under one provider (e.g.
  DeepSeek) would silently load under a different active provider. Provider,
  subagent limits, fallback chain, context window, and reasoning effort are now
  restored from saved session metadata, with `"deepseek"` as the default for
  legacy sessions.
- Raised the streamed model-response idle timeout and matched the TUI stall
  watchdog to the configured stream budget so long reasoning pauses are not
  recovered as stalled turns (#2487, #3998).
- Fixed Codex OAuth/sub-agent release diagnostics so `auth list` reports an
  active Codex OAuth file, Responses API child requests encode inherited tool
  names safely, rate-limited child requests checkpoint as resumable provider
  interruptions, and failure records surface the real Responses API error
  (#3884).
- Fixed fresh launch/setup testing with an explicit `CODEWHALE_HOME` so
  config, settings, theme prefs, and doctor legacy-state diagnostics do not
  inherit unrelated ambient `~/.deepseek` files (#4001, #4002).
- Sub-agent state now persists to `.codewhale/` instead of the lingering
  pre-rebrand `.deepseek/` path (#3864). Contributed by Stime (@yekern).
- `/plugin enable|disable` now persists across restarts (#3918), and the
  plugin command is hidden from the root slash menu and kept canonical after
  the scanner merge. Contributed by Nightt (@nightt5879).
- `/config ask-rules` now shows ask rule actions with improved diagnostics,
  with file-rule action precedence under test. Contributed by @greyfreedom.
- Fleet/sub-agents: enforced an absolute recursion-depth ceiling and widened
  task-id entropy, gave each atomic state write a unique temp path, kept
  sub-agent tool catalogs in parent parity (#3836), and made the Agents
  sidebar reconcile sub-agent completion and cancellation live (#3837).
- Fixed apply_patch mangling newlines, defaulted fuzz to 3, and made writes
  atomic; fixed compaction to preserve pins on emergency compaction, harden
  the summary fallback, and count image tokens; corrected backtrack boundary,
  checkpoint clear ordering, prune guard, and durable rename.
- Fixed the SSE client to flush the final frame, join multi-line data fields,
  and stop corrupting multibyte UTF-8 split across network reads.
- Kept review-only turns read-only, aliased `auto` mode to the agent policy,
  showed the mode-derived safety policy in status (contributed by @cyq1017),
  and stopped the durable-review floor from holding routine YOLO work
  (#3883).
- Fixed self-update to prefer exact binary release assets. Contributed by
  @LI-Jialu.
- UI polish: stopped constitution and fleet-profile model drafts from
  freezing the event loop, scoped the context-menu backdrop to the popup
  rect, stacked model-picker panes on narrow modals, unified display-width
  helpers on one contract (#3924), removed misleading success toasts,
  issue-number leaks, and dead-end empty states, and repaired the onboarding
  trust and api-key keys.
- Fixed the onboarding Trust step so plain Enter no longer silently grants
  workspace trust; users must choose the explicit trust or exit keys.
- Fixed same-root skill-name collisions being silently shadowed; duplicate
  normalized skill names now warn while keeping discovery deterministic
  (#3919).
- Normalized discovered skill names, removed unenforced trust copy, and
  surfaced the gated constitution override in prompts.
- Fixed a parallel `subagent::` suite flake where one test's process-wide
  `Retry-After` pause could strand unrelated budget-capped workers for the
  full stale window; requests now re-poll the global pause in bounded slices
  and the rate-limit test clears the window on drop.
- Sub-agent and Fleet reliability now fail empty, step-limited, and
  budget-exhausted children with explicit diagnostics instead of silent
  `Completed (no output)` success; budget exhaustion preserves partial output,
  `worktree: true` discovers one-level nested repos from harness directories,
  and completion-before-start delegate events recover into named rows instead
  of ellipsis-only identities (#4050, #4051, #4052, #4053).
- Goal-mode writing and research tasks can complete with
  `verification.status = "not_applicable"` without triggering continuation
  loops (#4054).
- First-run onboarding routes API keys through the selected provider, setup
  wizard bodies scroll with PageUp/PageDown, shipped locale packs are back to
  `en.json` parity with zh-Hant explicitly partial, stable feature flags stay
  out of Experimental, and model/provider rows include current LongCat and
  sourced-pricing hints (#4056, #4057, #4058, #4062, #4063).
- Running tool rows animate while a lone foreground tool is active, and
  workflow receipts render run/status/failure cards instead of one-line or
  null-success output (#4059).
- Model-facing turn metadata now includes a compact git workspace snapshot and
  escalates context pressure at the same thresholds as the TUI, helping agents
  narrow scope or compact before truncation (#4071, #4073).
- Successful child sub-agent completions inline the child's `EVIDENCE` block
  before the completion sentinel, so parents can cite child findings without
  re-running tools (#4072).
- Deferred tools hydrate and execute in the same batch when the original
  arguments are valid, and `[tools].always_load` now keeps configured MCP tools
  active instead of forcing the first-call retry. Thanks @SparkofSpike for the
  hot-path MCP report (#4074, #4027).
- New commit-range co-author checks reject bot/tool trailers on newly pushed
  commits; historical release-range cleanup remains a separate maintenance
  concern (#4075).
- Fixed fuzzy `edit_file` matching so matches that begin with multibyte UTF-8
  characters, including CJK text, advance on character boundaries instead of
  panicking. Contributed by Nightt (@nightt5879), reported by Taixin Guo
  (@taixinguo) (#3971, #4045).
- Fixed Unix dispatcher/TUI output under early-closing pipes such as
  `codewhale doctor | head` by restoring the default `SIGPIPE` handler before
  printing and propagating signal exits quietly. Contributed by @aznikline,
  reported by @BrathonBai (#4030, #4043).
- Suppressed dead_code warnings in the unused plugin registry module and
  fixed formatting across the command-group files. Contributed by Paulo Aboim
  Pinto (@aboimpinto).
- Pointed the website Community nav link at the community hub.

### Security

- MCP client hardening: closed an SSE-endpoint SSRF, bounded the HTTP
  response body via Content-Length instead of a streaming read, bounded stdio
  line reads to prevent OOM denial of service, fixed a dead timeout, and
  removed an unbounded buffer.
- Made execpolicy deny/trust rules segment-aware, closing a command-chaining
  bypass.
- Closed repo-law and safety-floor bypasses found by adversarial review:
  protected invariants are now enforced as mechanism, the destroyer gap in
  the safety floor is closed, a catalog-present tool with no execution path
  now fails closed, `web_run` open/click is classified as destructive, and
  the allow-list gained wildcard and case handling.
- Refused symlinked rules directories to prevent workspace escape via
  discovered rules. Contributed by maple (@yekern).
- Bounded Fleet sub-agent worker output so fanout cannot exhaust TUI memory
  (#3882), and preserved event headroom for progress. Contributed in part by
  @cyq1017.
- Added an untrusted constitution-draft gate with authoring provenance so
  model-drafted constitutions require explicit human ratification.

- Google Gemini is its own backend (`/provider google`) on the official
  OpenAI-compatible route with thought-signature capture/replay and
  fail-closed replay for thinking models. Antigravity (`agy` 1.1.13) joins
  as a separate credential-plane provider: consent-gated read-only import
  of the official CLI's login with `ANTIGRAVITY_API_KEY`/`AGY_ADC_AUTH`
  precedence; requests fail closed until the cloud-code wire protocol is
  implemented.

### Removed

- Removed unused model-registry helpers. Harvested from #3872 by @cyq1017.
- Removed unused request-tuning metadata. Harvested from #3871 by @cyq1017.
- Removed dead fleet task helpers (#3894 by @cyq1017), the unused
  approval-cache container (#3845) and localization QA metadata (both by
  @nightt5879), the dormant tab collaboration subsystem (#3838), the legacy
  flash auto-router (#3839), the stale project_doc loader (#3840), ignored
  mock LLM placeholders (#3841), dead model-catalog helpers (#3842), the
  unused execpolicy amend module, and dead MCP/client retry helpers.
- Retired the deprecated `WHALE.md` context fallback (#3798).

## [0.8.66] - 2026-06-29

### Added

- Added `codewhale doctor` / `codewhale doctor --json` legacy-state
  diagnostics that compare known `~/.deepseek` state paths with their
  `~/.codewhale` counterparts and flag unmigrated or dual-root data (#3727).
- Added Sakana AI Fugu as a first-class OpenAI-compatible provider with
  `sakana`/`fugu` aliases, `FUGU_API_KEY` / `SAKANA_API_KEY` discovery,
  provider-picker wiring, model completions, and provider docs. Harvested from
  #3748 by @lerugray.
- Added WhaleFlow-to-Fleet launch-shape validation: the default Fleet workflow
  contract allows up to 100 total agents and 5 recursive rings, requires
  bounded loops/expands before launch, and preserves per-slot model selection.
- Added a read-only `/config ask-rules` view for the resolved
  `permissions.toml` path, file status, rule count, and configured
  tool/command/path ask rules. Merged from #3569 by @greyfreedom.
- Added provider-level `context_window` overrides so OpenAI-compatible
  gateways and self-hosted providers can budget against their real model
  context window (#3545).
- Added the native `codew` shim to release archives, Windows installer inputs,
  local release-asset preparation, and checksum verification so manual installs
  receive the same short command that Cargo installs build.
- Added OpenModel as a first-class Anthropic Messages provider, with config,
  CLI, provider picker, docs, and registry coverage. Harvested from #3585 by
  @noaft.
- Added WeCom Bridge deployment and security documentation, with shipped
  runtime/bridge commands and approval-timeout environment guidance. Harvested
  from #3640 by @pkeging.
- Added a token/cache/cost `scorecard` command for offline release gating,
  baseline regression checks, and per-turn cost visibility (#3388). Stream-JSON
  exec metadata now also reports conservative `input_analysis` and
  `visible_final_answer_chars`, so benchmark harnesses can measure transcript
  growth and final-answer bloat without guessing (#2956, #2957).
- Added a release evidence ledger for v0.8.66 and opened the external ACP
  registry submission for CodeWhale after validating the published
  `codewhale@0.8.65` ACP auth handshake against the upstream registry checker
  (#3192).
- Added a typed `[verifier]` config table for the verifier-preview lane, with
  `enabled` and the shipped `verdict_policy = "hunt"` mapping documented and
  validated (#2093).
- Added Hotbar `Alt+1`–`Alt+8` quick-slot switching with decision-card key
  disambiguation, plus an introductory card that explains and can dismiss the
  Hotbar (#3796, #3788).
- Release/docs hygiene: guarded public install/version snippets and the npm
  `codewhaleBinaryVersion` pointer against drift, made `check-docs`/`check-facts`
  fail on stale snippets or unmapped providers, and stopped `sync-changelog`
  from dropping a release when only `[Unreleased]` exists (#3767, #3768, #3769,
  #3770, #3771, #3772).

### Changed

- Deferred Auto mode from the user-facing mode picker, cycle, hotbar, `/mode`
  command, and runtime-thread mode overrides until it has a distinct prompt and
  auto-review behavior; existing `auto` mode text now folds back to Agent
  instead of selecting a hollow mode, and approval modal copy no longer implies
  the current mode is YOLO (#3730, #3733).
- Clarified the Fleet setup surface and docs so Fleet is treated as the durable
  sub-agent configuration layer while WhaleFlow is the agent-authored
  orchestration plan that selects and monitors Fleet slots.
- Slimmed the default Constitution prompt while keeping its required structural
  anchors under regression coverage, reducing the static prompt footprint for
  cache-sensitive turns (#2953).
- Made the approval prompt inline and bottom-anchored instead of a full-screen
  takeover, so context and controls stay visible while a tool awaits a decision
  (#3799).
- The Hotbar is now hidden by default until explicit setup opt-in (#3807); the
  interactive Agent shell also defaults to approval-gated on with a shared
  baseline (#3756).
- Mode authority now resolves approval prompts through a single authority
  source instead of per-surface checks (#3795).

### Fixed

- Surfaced legacy state relocation with a user-visible migration notice whenever
  `~/.deepseek/<state>` is moved or copied into `~/.codewhale/<state>`, so
  upgraded users know their data was preserved and where the canonical state
  now lives (#3726).
- Restored legacy `.deepseek/sessions` visibility for upgraded installs where
  an empty `~/.codewhale/sessions` directory already existed, by copying
  missing legacy session entries into the primary CodeWhale session store
  without overwriting newer data (#3724).
- Calmed approval risk classification for read-only shell commands such as
  `codewhale --version`, `codewhale --help`, and `git status --porcelain` so
  the modal no longer labels proven read-only shell as destructive (#3730).
- Added provider/model route columns to `/cache` turn telemetry so DeepSeek
  cache-hit regressions can be correlated with Auto route changes (#3738).
- Fixed runtime API approval handling so workspace trust no longer auto-resolves
  ordinary tool approvals; trust now only participates in full-access retry
  decisions while YOLO/auto-approve remains the approval bypass (#3736).
- Fixed modal surfaces so the shared view stack paints an opaque backdrop before
  any overlay, while Plan/request-input popup interiors stay opaque and the Plan
  confirmation footer keeps action choices visible on narrow terminals (#3732).
- Added a turn-loop Plan-mode guard for file-writing tools and write-capable MCP
  tools so Plan's "no writes" promise is enforced before approval or execution,
  not only by the sandbox/catalog layer (#3734).
- Preserved the durable review safety floor for publish-like shell actions in
  YOLO mode, so `cargo publish`, `npm publish`, and tag/release pushes force
  approval instead of silently auto-approving (#3735).
- Fixed Ctrl+O external-editor freezes where CodeWhale's terminal input pump
  could keep reading keys while Vim/editor owned the terminal, especially in
  Windows mintty/cygwin shells. Thanks @buko for the precise repro (#3657).
- Hardened the OHOS dependency drift check against transient Cargo registry EOFs
  by retrying the dependency graph probe before failing CI.
- Updated the `/links` provider fallback to the current CodeWhale docs URL and
  added a Baidu Qianfan docs link. Harvested from #3621 by @noaft.
- Hardened `CODEWHALE_TOOL_SURFACE=shell-only` for benchmark/exec runs: the
  shell-only surface hides native tools from the model-visible catalog, and
  unknown `CODEWHALE_TOOL_SURFACE` values now warn instead of silently falling
  back to the full tool surface (#2954).
- Sub-agent fanout and lock hot paths: preserved event-channel headroom for
  progress events (#3783, thanks @cyq1017), let independent sub-agent starts
  join a single parallel dispatch batch instead of serializing (#3801), rendered
  the sub-agent sidebar/ListSubAgents from a read-only snapshot with bounded
  cleanup (#3803), used nonblocking best-effort sends for ListSubAgents refresh
  while still awaiting critical events (#3802), moved sub-agent state
  persistence disk I/O off the manager write lock (#3805), and used `try_lock`
  for shell-manager refresh in async UI paths (#3804).
- Provenance: runtime continuations and `SubAgentHandoff` now inherit standing
  YOLO authority, while `MemoryRecall`, `ImportedTranscript`, and
  `AssistantGenerated` inputs remain guarded (#3817).
- Approval honesty: labeled session-scoped approvals accurately instead of
  "always", and surfaced approval decisions in tool results (#3766).

## [0.8.65] - 2026-06-24

### Added

- **Provider/model/route resolution (EPIC #2608).** Canonical provider, model,
  offering, and route types with a single `RouteResolver` that produces a
  resolved `ReadyRouteCandidate` (endpoint, wire protocol, model id, context
  limit, price) for every switch (#3458, #3084, #3384). The executing client is
  now constructed from the resolved candidate rather than re-derived from config
  (#3384). A committed, network-free Models.dev-shaped catalog gives models real
  context windows and pricing, with a secret-free live cache (#3497, #3498,
  #3385). Offering pricing with provenance is projected onto candidates (#3501,
  #3085), and route limits feed a route-aware context-budget service (#3508,
  #3523, #3086).
- **Fleet execution substrate (EPIC #3154).** Fleet profile types and config
  (#3469), durable manager resume, workspace agent-profile loading resolved into
  the worker runtime (#3367), loadout intent carried in task specs (#3512), and
  receipts that persist the resolved route for inspection (#3154, #3166). Worker
  status is folded into the unified `/fleet` surface and exposed through the
  Runtime API.
- **Provider surfaces.** A `/provider` readiness dashboard with reasoning
  readiness, an experimental/supported maturity marker, and an "open models for
  this provider" action (#3083, #2984, #3485); cross-provider `/model` search
  with scroll and provider type-ahead (#3484, #3075); inline `<think>`
  reasoning-stream routing with per-provider overrides (#3222); usage telemetry
  normalized into canonical token classes including Responses cache-miss and
  reasoning tokens (#2961, #3509); and remote MCP OAuth login with bearer/header
  auth precedence (#3527).
- **More providers and routes.** User-defined OpenAI-compatible custom providers
  via `[providers.<name>]` (#1519); a DeepSeek Anthropic-compatible route (#2963,
  #3449); a Qianfan route (#3425); Zhipu folded into Z.ai with equal-treatment
  model normalization (#3539); DashScope/Together fixtures.
- **Localized mode picker and composer indicators.** The `/mode` picker prompt,
  mode names, and hints, plus the composer's Vim mode indicator, now render in
  all seven shipped locales (model-facing mode labels stay English). Harvested
  from #2239 by @gordonlu.
- **Website and automation.** A runtime/integrations page, provenance and
  mirror-trust copy, a fact-drift CI gate, a published install script, and a
  weekly community digest archive on codewhale.net (#3419, #3421, #3415, #3482,
  #3420); per-automation mode/shell/trust/approval settings (#3467).
- **Model reference browser.** A read-only `/modeldb` command (aliases
  `model-reference`, `modelref`) opens a pager over the bundled catalog — every
  model's factual context window, max output, modality, and price, grouped by
  provider/kind. Labels only: it never selects, routes, or tiers a model
  (#3205, #2300).
- **Transcript presets.** A `/config preset <name> [--save]` mechanism with a
  first `calm` preset — calm mode, calm tool collapse, comfortable spacing, and
  low motion — presentation-only and evidence-preserving (#3478).
- **Model capability profiles.** A typed `model_profile` module separates
  intrinsic model facts from resolved provider-route capability, so compact
  routes defer heavier nonessential tools while standard/full routes keep the
  eager tool surface (#3451, #3365).
- **Live provider catalog refresh.** A secret-free `/models` live-fetch layer
  (401/403/404/429 mapped to typed outcomes) feeds the catalog cache; the API
  key authorizes the request but is never persisted into the delta or cache
  (#3385).

### Changed

- **Config modularization (#3311).** `ProviderKind` (#3505), harness posture
  (#3507), and provider default seeds (#3503) moved into dedicated modules, and
  the `config.rs` monolith split into clean leaf modules (paths, search,
  model/base-URL constants, sub-agent limits) behind a `pub use` facade.
  `AppMode` helpers were centralized (#3510), and mode-vs-permission policy is
  now derived through a single `base_policy_for_mode` resolver instead of
  scattered mutation (#3386, advisory review-intent behavior preserved).
- **Leaner tool surface.** Dropped `task_shell_*` from the active set and folded
  `tool_search_*` (#3463); ablated the in-turn loop_guard and encoded reasoning
  dispositions (#3462); added the Orchestration disposition to the constitution.
- **Routing.** Provider/model switches and the capability-aware fallback chain
  resolve through `RouteResolver`; reasoning effort is normalized for the
  *resolved* provider; the fallback chain now skips providers that lack auth
  (#2574); and context window and memory-pressure come from the resolved route
  (#3086).
- **UX.** Approval modal gained a group divider and selected-row caret (#3515);
  picker scroll/type-ahead and selection contrast hardened (#3500); the README
  was rewritten as an architecture end-cap (#3087); and repo agent guidance was
  de-hardcoded to live truth.
- **Fleet identity and defaults.** Fleet workers now enter with an explicit
  "summoned Fleet member" operating contract, setup/profile prompts keep the
  default model behavior as same-route inheritance, and generated worker
  instructions avoid leaking recursive topology that only the orchestrator
  needs.
- **Legacy swarm cleanup.** Removed the obsolete `/swarm` core command/menu
  registration so `/fleet` is the product surface, while `/subagents` remains a
  compatibility shortcut to worker status.
- **Running-state animation.** Tool cards and background-task rows now share one
  faster braille spinner cadence, so Bash/background work reads consistently
  alive across the transcript and sidebar.
- **Restored contributor credit.** Threaded machine-readable credit
  (`docs/CONTRIBUTORS.md` + `.github/AUTHOR_MAP`) for earlier merged work that
  shipped without it, including the `/jobs cancel-all` action and the npm
  retry-timeout hint (#1538) by @jieshu666, and the community ACP adapter
  reference by @rockeverm3m.

### Fixed

- **Release hygiene.** The strict `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --locked
  -- -D warnings` gate passes; `npm run build` no longer dirties the generated
  web facts; the site sets `metadataBase`; the community digest page parses each
  record independently and localizes its chrome; and `cargo audit` is clean with
  the starlark-transitive unmaintained advisories documented.
- **Routing and mode correctness.** Ordinary prompt text is no longer
  interpreted as a mode switch (#3387, #3491); model candidates are scoped to the
  active provider; Together-owned DeepSeek routes are accepted (#3426); insecure
  `http://` custom endpoints raise an advisory warning (#1519); and the Fleet
  setup planner's role/model selection now drives the generated profile.
- **Runtime stability.** MCP connection drops are explicit (#3524), HTTP API
  calls reuse a shared MCP pool (#3532), and per-agent sub-agent mailbox
  telemetry is throttled to cut UI lag (#3454).
- **YOLO background-shell approvals.** A background shell command no longer pops
  an approval modal in YOLO mode. `classify_risk` marks all shell commands
  destructive, so the auto-review safety floor held every *background* shell for
  review, and the `ForcePrompt` site never checked `auto_approve` — only
  background commands surfaced it, since foreground shells take the
  `Interactive` origin and skip that branch.
- **Bash approval modal fit.** The shell approval modal now labels Bash
  commands directly, avoids repeating command/workdir in the impact summary,
  wraps long commands, and switches to compact controls on short terminals so
  the decision keys stay visible.
- **Custom-provider picker rows.** Concrete `[providers.<name>]` entries now
  appear in the provider picker (id, endpoint, auth readiness, wire protocol,
  current model) instead of only the generic placeholder; auth readiness honors
  per-entry key/env/metadata/no-auth/loopback.
- **Passive MCP tool discovery.** Runtime API-owned stdio MCP processes are no
  longer spawned from passive `/v1/apps/mcp/tools` requests; live discovery
  remains available through `?connect=true`. `doctor` now warns on relative-path
  stdio MCP commands without `cwd`.

## [0.8.64] - 2026-06-22

### Added

- **Seamless auto-compaction defaults.** Known large-context routes now keep
  automatic compaction on by default while carrying summaries forward through
  the stable prompt path, reducing surprise context loss without changing
  explicit opt-out behavior.
- **Runtime web automation readiness.** Local app automation gains a
  loopback-only dev-server readiness primitive so agents can wait for TCP and
  optional HTTP health checks before browser verification. Harvested from
  #3376 by @cyq1017.
- **Model and integration polish.** `/model pro` and `/model flash` shortcuts
  now resolve to the current DeepSeek V4 routes while preserving existing model
  IDs. Harvested from #3350 by @KUK4. The WeCom bridge landed with
  maintainer follow-up hardening for state permissions and chat-facing error
  reporting, from #3370 by @pkeging.

### Fixed

- **Security and trust-boundary hardening.** Project-local config can no longer
  loosen user-owned shell or instruction-file policy, file edits now require a
  fresh read of the target file, git history inputs reject option-shaped or
  control-character revisions, interactive execution surfaces require approval,
  and local tool paths are narrowed through workspace/root validation.
- **Runtime and diagnostics redaction.** Generated runtime/app-server tokens,
  raw session lineage identifiers, provider registry drift values, review
  receipt internals, and webhook URLs are no longer echoed into human-facing
  logs or diagnostics.
- **Network and alert safety.** Provider TLS verification bypass requests now
  fail closed, fleet alert webhooks require HTTPS, fetch URL hostnames are
  resolved before requests, and runtime mobile auth no longer relies on
  token-bearing URLs.
- **Path-state hardening.** Config sibling files, project MCP cwd values,
  runtime thread store files, sub-agent state, project-local state roots, and
  app-server sidecar config paths now resolve through checked roots before
  reads/writes.
- **Release CI repair.** Nightly cross-target builds install Rust targets
  explicitly and retry transient cargo failures; auto-tag runs are serialized
  and treat an already-created remote tag as a no-op. Safe slices harvested
  from #3374 by @donglovejava.
- **Provider wait and sidebar regressions.** Provider-wait footers suppress
  noisy countdowns until useful while keeping timeout warnings visible,
  harvested from #3375 by @idling11. The pinned sidebar can render at a
  narrower 64-column boundary, harvested from #3371 by @donglovejava.
- **Delegated server cleanup.** Delegated `serve` / `app-server` children gain
  OS-level parent-death cleanup on supported platforms, completing the #3259
  follow-up from #3378 and #3317 by @wuisabel-gif.
- **ACP and sandbox correctness.** ACP sessions preserve multi-turn
  conversation history across prompt turns, harvested from #3372 by @xulongzhe.
  Worktree Git metadata writes are allowed through sandbox policy without
  broad trust-mode escalation, from #3356 by @cyq1017 and the #3355 report by
  @linletian.

### Changed

- **Community and dependency harvests.** The release train carries focused
  community-credit slices from #3379 by @greyfreedom, #3348 by @nightt5879,
  #3346 by @hongqitai, #3345/#3333 by @cyq1017, and Dependabot updates for
  `windows`, `toml`, `tokio`, `lru`, `similar`, and web tooling security locks.
- **Public release surface cleanup.** Benchmark-specific materials were kept
  out of the public release repo; benchmark source fragments belong in the
  separate `codewhale-bench` lane.

## [0.8.63] - 2026-06-19

### Added

- **Sub-agent fanout safeguards (#3318, #3319).** High-fanout Workflow runs can
  now queue and drain more agents than the instantaneous concurrency cap by
  default, with `[subagents] max_admitted` available to tune that bounded
  admission population. Distinct `agent` calls are no longer capped by the
  per-turn loop guard before runtime launch concurrency and provider
  rate-limit backoff can apply. `[subagents] token_budget` applies a shared
  aggregate token ceiling to a root `agent` run and its descendants.
- **Per-worker sub-agent token enforcement (#3321).** A `token_budget` /
  `max_tokens` set on an individual `agent` call now bounds that single worker
  mid-run: once its accumulated model tokens exceed the cap it stops cleanly
  with a `budget_exhausted` status instead of running to `max_steps`. This
  complements the scope-level admission gate (#3319) — the per-worker cap stops
  one runaway worker, the scope cap bounds total fan-out — without
  double-counting. Harvested from #3321 by @donglovejava.
- **Provider-specific sub-agent fanout config.** `[subagents.providers.<provider>]`
  profiles now override `enabled`, `max_concurrent`, `max_admitted`,
  `launch_concurrency`, `max_depth`, token budget, API timeout, and heartbeat
  timeout for the active provider. Use broad direct-API profiles such as
  `[subagents.providers.deepseek]` and tighter subscription profiles such as
  `[subagents.providers.glm]`; `/config subagents status` shows both global
  and active-provider resolved values.
- **Sub-agent control and isolation.** The single `agent` tool now exposes
  status, peek, and cancel actions for running children, and accepts
  `worktree: true` to create an isolated git worktree/branch for parallel edit
  lanes instead of requiring callers to hand-roll a `cwd`.

### Fixed

- **Mode and tool catalog correctness.** Core action tools remain discoverable
  in the model-facing catalog/tool search, and a consistency self-check flags
  registered handlers that drift out of the advertised catalog. Review-looking
  prompts in explicit Agent/YOLO mode now keep the requested mode and tools,
  with only an advisory review hint.
- **Sub-agent orchestration recovery.** Child agents now retry transient
  provider header/SSE timeouts before failing, and parent runs synthesize missed
  child completions from terminal child state so orchestration cannot hang on a
  lost completion event.
- **DeepSeek thinking tool calls.** DeepSeek chat-completions requests now omit
  explicit `tool_choice` whenever reasoning/thinking is enabled, avoiding
  provider rejections while leaving no-thinking routes unchanged.
- **Task sidebar shortcuts and attribution.** Ctrl-K stays palette/emacs-kill,
  while Ctrl-X is scoped to Tasks-sidebar background shell cancellation. Shell
  jobs launched by sub-agents now render with their child-agent owner in the
  Tasks sidebar and transcript.
- **Long-turn recovery and context economy.** Repeated read-only search
  loop blocks now return guidance instead of fatal tool failures, Python build
  failures that are missing `setuptools` include an install/retry hint, long
  foreground shell timeouts steer models toward background execution, and noisy
  shell/test/web outputs are compacted earlier for large-context routes.
- **Config display redaction.** `codew config get/list` now recursively masks
  token-, secret-, password-, credential-, and authorization-like keys inside
  unknown `extras` tables and redacts sensitive HTTP header values before
  printing config output.
- **Queued follow-up hints and force-steer keys.** The pending-input preview now
  advertises `Ctrl+S send now` whenever queued follow-ups exist, and
  Ctrl/Cmd+Enter force-steering also accepts the common Ctrl+J terminal
  encoding while a turn is running.
- **Sidebar default visibility restored (#3328).** New and upgraded sessions
  now use a pinned composed sidebar by default when the terminal is wide
  enough, so live Agents and Tasks surface without opting back into idle
  auto-collapse. Older settings files that captured the v0.8.62 auto-collapse
  default now migrate to `pinned` unless `/sidebar auto --save` records an
  explicit opt-in. `/sidebar` now reports when width or auto-collapse
  suppresses rendering instead of saying the sidebar is visible. Reported by
  @dxfq.
- **JavaScript execution proxy env handling (#3273, #3331).** `js_execution`
  now enables Node's environment-proxy mode when proxy variables are present,
  mirrors lowercase proxy variables for the child process, and backfills
  `HTTP_PROXY` / `HTTPS_PROXY` from `ALL_PROXY`. Reported by @lordwedggie and
  harvested from #3331 by @cyq1017.
- **Legacy app-server non-loopback auth hardening (#3258).** Bare
  `codewhale app-server --host 0.0.0.0` now fails fast unless an explicit
  `--auth-token` or `CODEWHALE_APP_SERVER_TOKEN` is supplied, keeping generated
  one-time `cwapp_*` tokens loopback-only.
- **Legacy `.deepseek` state write-path migration (#3240).** State subdirectories
  (`sessions`, `slop_ledger`, `trophies`, `catalog`) are now always written under
  `~/.codewhale/`, and the first write of a subdir relocates any pre-existing
  `~/.deepseek/<sub>` contents into the primary location so the legacy tree stops
  growing while old data is preserved. The read resolver still finds legacy data
  for backfill until each subdir migrates. Reported by @Final527; onboarding
  marker slice from #3302 by @nightt5879.
- **State subdir validation on Windows (#3240).** State path hardening now
  rejects rooted/prefixed subdir strings such as `/etc` before resolving or
  migrating state directories, keeping the `.codewhale` write resolver inside
  its state root across platforms.

## [0.8.62] - 2026-06-17

### Changed

- **GLM-5.2 is now the default direct Z.AI model.** `DEFAULT_ZAI_MODEL` resolves
  to `GLM-5.2` in both `codewhale-tui` and `codewhale-config`; the `glm-5.1`
  alias still resolves to `GLM-5.1` (the defaulting was decoupled from the alias
  arm so it no longer tracks the default). Docs and `config.example.toml` no
  longer describe GLM-5.2 as an opt-in preview.
- **GLM-5-Turbo registered as a real model** and wired as the faster/explore
  sub-agent sibling for the GLM family: a `GLM-5.2` parent routes
  faster/explore children to `GLM-5-Turbo` (direct Z.ai) and `z-ai/glm-5-turbo`
  (OpenRouter), instead of down to GLM-5.1. GLM-5.1 and GLM-5-Turbo themselves
  have no cheaper tier and keep children on the parent.
- **`type: "explore"` sub-agents default to `model_strength: "faster"`.** Bounded
  read-only lookup/search/status work now uses the cheaper same-family sibling
  automatically, unless an explicit `model` or `model_strength: "same"` is
  supplied. Non-explore roles keep the conservative `same` default.
- **GPT-5.5 / OpenAI Codex faster route stays on GPT-5.5** with reasoning
  resolved to `low` (the Codex Responses API has no true `off`, so the resolved
  effort is now honest `low` rather than `off` silently rewritten). No
  DeepSeek/GLM fallback is fabricated when no cheaper same-provider sibling
  exists. DeepSeek Pro→Flash routing and its no-thinking faster lane are
  unchanged.
- **Base prompt / delegate skill guidance** updated to encourage parallel
  read-only exploration (2-4 `type: "explore"` sub-agents) for broad repo,
  version, branch, release, and API-surface investigations, while keeping
  architecture, integration, and final verification in the parent. The
  delegate skill examples now use provider-neutral `model_strength` instead of
  hardcoded DeepSeek model ids.
- **Agent synthesis guardrails.** The base constitution now frames tools around
  sufficient evidence rather than open-ended persistence: extra reads, searches,
  and delegation must target a missing fact, and agents should answer with
  limits instead of broadening searches indefinitely. The runtime loop guard
  now blocks duplicate read-only/delegated calls earlier and caps repeated
  broad lookup/delegation loops in a single turn with a synthesis-forcing tool
  error. Guard metadata distinguishes exact duplicates
  (`identical_tool_call`) from no-progress loops (`no_progress_tool_loop`).
- **Sub-agent handoff and visibility.** Direct sub-agent completions are drained
  before the next parent model request, so finished children can wake the main
  model promptly instead of waiting for an empty-tool-use branch or idle engine
  path. Nested sub-agents now report completions to their immediate parent
  inbox; the main model still receives only direct-child completions, avoiding
  grandchild floods while preserving nested evidence flow. Sub-agent output
  guidance now requires child-agent provenance when a sub-agent relies on a
  child report: cite the child `agent_id` and the child's EVIDENCE line(s), and
  do not present child findings as directly verified facts. The sidebar orders
  sub-agents as a parent/child tree and annotates nested rows with parent and
  depth information in hover text.
- **Sub-agent summary provenance (#2652).** A sub-agent's free-text result is now
  explicitly treated as an unverified self-report rather than confirmed
  evidence. The completion sentinel carries `summary_kind: complete | truncated`
  so the parent model can branch on whether it saw the full report or a clipped
  excerpt. Short summaries (≤ 12,000 chars) get a soft "re-verify material
  claims" suffix; longer ones are head+tail truncated with an honest marker
  stating the elided middle is not retrievable via `retrieve_tool_result`.
  Every summary therefore carries exactly one boundary marker, never both.
- **Provider metadata centralization.** Provider env vars, config keys, aliases,
  and auth hints are now resolved through the shared `ProviderMetadata` registry
  across `codewhale-config`, `codewhale-tui`, and `codewhale-cli`, reducing drift
  between the provider picker, `codewhale auth`, `doctor --json`, and setup
  hints.

### Added

- **Agent clarification questions (#3102).** Agents now have a first-class
  `request_user_input` tool to ask the user structured clarifying questions
  through a modal UI surface instead of only emitting a chat message and hoping
  the user notices. Mirrors the approval/secret-request flow the harness
  already used for permissions. The tool accepts 1-3 questions, each with a
  header, an id, 2-4 selectable options (label + description), and
  `allow_free_text` / `multi_select` flags (both default to `false` for
  back-compat). Input is validated up front with actionable errors. Wired
  across all layers: the `request_user_input` tool, engine handling
  (`turn_loop` → `approval`), an interactive TUI modal (`UserInputView`) with
  full keyboard navigation, and the runtime protocol
  (`EventFrame::UserInputRequest` + `AppRequest::SubmitUserInput`) so headless
  / app-server clients can answer programmatically. Parity tests cover the
  wire round-trip and the omitted-flags default.
- **Transcript hyperlinks — out-of-band OSC 8 (#3029).** Clickable file /
  file:line / URL links now reach the terminal through a column-drift-safe
  path. Link payloads are embedded in-band by the markdown renderer, then
  extracted out of the ratatui buffer cells and re-emitted out-of-band by
  `ColorCompatBackend` — so the `ESC` bytes never occupy display columns or
  corrupt selection. Supporting terminals get live hyperlinks; others see the
  label text unchanged. Clipboard/selection extraction strips residual codes as
  defense-in-depth.
- **CodeWhale-only skill discovery gate (#3296).** New
  `[skills].scan_codewhale_only = true` limits session-time skill discovery to
  CodeWhale-owned roots (`<workspace>/.codewhale/skills`, `~/.codewhale/skills`,
  and any explicit `skills_dir`) while ignoring cross-tool directories such as
  `.claude/skills`, `.opencode/skills`, `.cursor/skills`, and `~/.agents/skills`.
  The default remains the broad compatibility scan.
- **Permission/ask runtime rules (#3295).** Sibling `permissions.toml` ask-only
  rules are now loaded by the TUI engine and applied to `exec_shell` before
  Auto/session approval shortcuts. Matching ask rules force an approval prompt
  in otherwise auto-approved flows and are rejected under
  `approval_mode = "never"`.
- **Runtime API no-auth documentation.** `docs/RUNTIME_API.md` now documents
  `codewhale app-server --insecure-no-auth` for loopback-only testing and warns
  against combining it with `--mobile` on `0.0.0.0`.

### Fixed

- **TUI polish.** The empty-startup welcome block is centered by the actual
  rendered text width, fixing the off-center layout left over from the old
  sidebar-oriented welcome composition. Streaming HTTP body read errors now
  explain whether CodeWhale can retry before output, or is surfacing a warning
  after partial output to avoid replaying and duplicating streamed text.
- **Config comment preservation.** Rewriting `config.toml`, `settings.toml`, or
  `tui.toml` now merges user comments and formatting back into the serialized
  document; if comment merge fails, the write falls back to plain serialized
  output rather than failing.
- **Snapshot gate respected for per-tool snapshots (#3292).** Per-tool snapshots
  now check `[snapshots].enabled` before writing, matching the existing
  session-level gate.
- **Poppler `pdftotext` detection (#1667).** The dependency resolver now probes
  `pdftotext -v` instead of `--version`, because Poppler treats `--version` as
  an input filename. Fixes detection on systems where only Poppler is installed.
- **Plan confirmation checklist visibility.** The Plan-mode confirmation modal
  now shows the active checklist under the plan details, so users can review the
  concrete `checklist_write` work breakdown before accepting or revising a plan.

## [0.8.61] - 2026-06-15

This release lands the **runtime control plane** for multi-agent work: the TUI stays
responsive while sub-agents run, sub-agents converge toward fleet-style durable workers
with per-role model routing, and provider/model routes are isolated per session. It also
folds in several community contributions.

### Added

- **WhaleFlow runtime foundations** — worker runtime profiles (role / permissions / shell /
  tools / model-route, with non-escalating child derivation), a cross-provider model registry
  with offline catalog hydration, and provider-readiness / context-budget / provider-adapter /
  resource-telemetry services. (#3217, #3071, #3072, #3073)
- **Per-role, heterogeneous-model sub-agent routing** — sub-agents can be assigned a model and
  provider per role (e.g. scout vs. synthesis; verifiers route to a fast model). (#2027, #1768)
- **Durable goal mode** — cross-turn goal progress with token/time accounting and a
  verifier-as-judge gate before a goal may complete. (#3215, #891, #1976, #2058, #2029)
- Parent-visible worker interaction contract — a recommended action per worker. (#3226)
- Maintainer GitHub workflow skills; ACP registry submission prepared. (#3192)
- OpenAI-compatible `/v1/chat/completions` endpoint on the legacy app-server HTTP transport,
  provider-neutral, with model registry resolution and configured-credential forwarding.

### Changed

- **Sub-agents converge toward fleet-style durable workers** — real worker lifecycle states are
  projected to the sidebar instead of a hardcoded "running", and a sub-agent returns a structured
  needs-input checkpoint instead of parking. (#3226, #3096, #3154)
- The per-turn runtime tag exposes capability posture instead of human-facing mode labels. (#3213)
- Independent shell and verifier work defaults to background jobs with nonblocking waits and a
  completion notification; blocking now requires an explicit wait. (#3212)
- Sub-agent launches now expose explicit `model_strength` and `thinking` controls to the model
  instead of hidden child-model auto-routing; `explore` work is documented as a good fit for
  faster models and `thinking: "off"`.
- Plan mode is strictly read-only (no shell tools), consistent with its runtime posture.
- `/swarm` is gated behind the durable worker substrate. (#3218)
- Legacy `deepseek` install/update path resolves to `codewhale`. (#2960, #2924, #2917)

### Fixed

- **TUI freeze when multiple sub-agents spawn (launch blocker)** — the terminal input pump runs
  off the render thread, AgentProgress events are coalesced, and sub-agents no longer park on
  input with no orchestrator to answer; a six-worker stress test guards input/render/cancel
  liveness. (#3216, #3096)
- Idle sub-agent completion notifications now resume the parent turn instead of waiting for a
  later user message; thanks @giovanni-paolilla for the deadlock report (#3266).
- **Provider/model route isolation** — provider and model state is session-local, and a
  mismatched provider+model tuple is rejected at the route boundary. (#3227)
- Route-effective context-window metadata, over-limit preflight, and bounded recovery from
  `context_length_exceeded` instead of re-looping. (#3204)
- Synchronous tools (`file_search`, `grep_files`, `list_dir`) are cancellable and no longer hold
  a turn open against cancellation. (#1791)
- MCP stdio proxy startup prompts no longer strand YOLO / non-interactive runs. (#2475)
- Stalled / failed background-shell recovery; configurable sub-agent API timeout. (#1737, #1786, #1806)
- Composer: reliable queued steering + Ctrl+S send (#3203, #3224); footer busy/idle indicator
  (#2982); CJK word-wrap (#963); clickable sidebar stop targets (#3028); live token throughput
  (#3190); auto-expiring terminal sub-agent cards (#3078).
- Linux glibc preflight in the installer/update path with a clear error. (#3207, #1067)
- Self-update retries transient GitHub metadata/asset failures and falls back from the GitHub
  REST API to the public `releases/latest` redirect before constructing release asset URLs. (#3232)
- Provider picker lists providers in neutral alphabetical order instead of hard-coding DeepSeek first; the active provider stays pre-selected. (#3076)
- Work sidebar no longer shows stale `phase now:` / `phase next:` strategy rows once the checklist
  is 100% complete.
- Plan mode no longer shortcuts investigation for requests that name a repository, URL, version,
  release, build state, bug, PR, issue, API surface, or local code path.
- Oversized pasted text stays editable in the composer, with a file backup appended at submit
  time for model access; thanks @idling11 (#3267, closes #3263).
- Bare digit keys `1`-`8` now insert text instead of firing hotbar slots; use `Alt+digit` for
  hotbar actions. Thanks @wjq2026 for the report and @DieMoe233 for the paste-path note (#3243).
- Kimi/Moonshot tool schemas normalize empty function parameters to a root object schema; thanks
  @jghwwnq for the provider repro (#3265).
- Novita defaults to its OpenAI-compatible `/openai/v1` endpoint so chat completions no longer
  404 out of the box; thanks @buko for the report and endpoint verification (#3255).
- Dependency security: `ws` pinned to 8.21.0 across npm packages to close remote memory-exhaustion
  DoS (dependabot).

## [0.8.60] - 2026-06-13

### Added

- **Agent Fleet real-run cutover (#3154/#3096).** `codewhale fleet run` now
  launches durable workers through the headless `codewhale exec --output-format
  stream-json` path instead of the local simulation interpreter, with terminal
  worker events freeing leases so queued fleet tasks continue running.
- **Read-only shell parallelism (#2983).** The engine can now run conservative
  read-only shell calls in parallel, including strict `bash`/`sh`/`zsh -c`
  wrappers for whitelisted commands, while writes, stdin, background TTY work,
  redirects, pipes, command substitution, and follow-mode tails stay serial.
- **Declarative JS/TS WhaleFlow authoring (#3097).** WhaleFlow now accepts a
  compile-only `workflow({...})` JavaScript/TypeScript authoring form that
  lowers into the existing `WorkflowSpec` validator without executing user
  JavaScript.
- **Slash-menu Ctrl+P/Ctrl+N navigation (#3196).** The slash command menu now
  supports Ctrl+P/Ctrl+N movement without letting the global file picker steal
  focus while the menu is open. Thanks @1Git2Clone for the PR.
- **New models and first-party provider routes.** This release adds
  **GLM-5.2** (selectable on the Z.ai Coding Plan and over OpenRouter as
  `z-ai/glm-5.2`, alongside the existing GLM-5.1 default), a first-party
  **Z.ai** provider route, a first-party **StepFun / StepFlash** route
  (`step-3.7-flash`), and a first-party **MiniMax** route defaulting to
  `MiniMax-M3` with the M2.7/M2.5/M2.1 family selectable (#3187/#3191).

### Changed

- **README and contributor credits.** The README now has a shorter public
  overview and moves the full contributor ledger to `docs/CONTRIBUTORS.md`,
  preserving public thanks for [DeepSeek](https://github.com/deepseek-ai),
  [DataWhale](https://github.com/datawhalechina),
  [OpenWarp](https://github.com/zerx-lab/warp), and
  [Open Design](https://github.com/nexu-io/open-design).
- **Fleet-backed sub-agent direction.** Runtime docs now state the intended
  cutover clearly: "sub-agent" is role/UX vocabulary, while durable detached
  work should converge on the fleet-backed worker lifecycle with retries,
  receipts, and ledgered inspection.

### Fixed

- **Sub-agent eval no longer blocks by default.** `agent_eval` now returns the
  current projection immediately and delivers follow-up input without waiting
  for a running child to finish its provider call. Pass `block:true` for an
  intentional terminal wait.
- **Z.ai GLM thinking traces.** Direct Z.ai requests now use the documented
  `thinking` shape, preserve and replay `reasoning_content`, classify GLM
  reasoning streams as thinking output, and accept `ultracode` as a max-effort
  alias.
- **Claude skill archive compatibility (#2743).** `/skill install` keeps
  portable Claude-style skill folders supported while rejecting multi-skill
  Claude plugin archives clearly instead of silently installing only one skill
  and dropping plugin semantics. Thanks @AiurArtanis for the ecosystem request.

## [0.8.59] - 2026-06-12

### Added

- **Moonshot Kimi K2.7 Code model.** The Moonshot/Kimi provider now defaults to
  `kimi-k2.7-code`, recognizes `kimi`/`kimi-k2` aliases for that model, keeps
  explicit `kimi-k2.6` selectable, and adds the OpenRouter
  `moonshotai/kimi-k2.7-code` registry row.
- **Concise verbosity mode (#3052).** CLI noninteractive launches now default
  to concise prompt/output discipline unless overridden by config, env, or
  `--verbosity`, while interactive TUI launches remain normal by default.
  Thanks @cyq1017 for the PR.
- **Ephemeral generated project context (#3058).** Opening CodeWhale in a
  directory with no instruction files now keeps the bounded generated project
  overview in memory instead of creating `.codewhale/instructions.md`.
- **ACP registry auth metadata (#1447).** The ACP stdio adapter now advertises
  terminal authentication setup in `initialize.authMethods`, matching the
  registry's validation requirement.
- **Sidebar context menus (#3065).** Right-clicking the sidebar no longer shows
  `Paste`; clickable sidebar rows now offer their row command as the first
  context action.
- **Sidebar hover popovers (#3088).** Streaming turns now keep sidebar hover
  popovers responsive while continuing to throttle transcript/body mouse
  motion.
- **Dark-theme selection contrast (#3074, thanks @drpars).** Session, config,
  help, context-menu, and approval selections now use the muted selection
  background instead of the bright accent color.
- **Cursor-style activity metadata rows (#3146).** Dense successful tool-run
  summaries now render as a single muted `Explored ...` / `Updated metadata`
  row, include short command-family labels for successful generic verifier
  groups, and keep keyboard/mouse expansion and detail inspection intact.
- **Provider-wait observability (#3095).** Footer stall reasons now name the
  active provider/model route, idle seconds vs stream budget, and whether a
  fanout plan is still at `0 running` or dispatch is pending. Structured
  provider-wait incidents log once per turn from the main tick loop (not on
  every footer redraw).
- **Interactive fanout launch gate (#3095).** Direct sub-agent children queue
  behind a configurable semaphore (`[subagents] interactive_max_launch`,
  default 4) with a visible `queued: waiting for an interactive fanout slot`
  reason before their first model step.
- **Goal lifecycle controls.** `/goal` is now the primary command surface for
  session goals, with `pause`, `resume`, `complete`, `blocked`, and `clear`
  controls while `/hunt` remains a compatibility alias.
- **Persistent thread-goal API.** App-server clients can now set, get, and clear
  durable thread goals through `thread/goal/set`, `thread/goal/get`, and
  `thread/goal/clear`, backed by the state store with Codex-style status and
  token/time accounting fields.
- **Command-boundary ownership layers (#2888/#3055).** Built-in slash command
  metadata now lives in `commands/registry.rs`, slash parsing in
  `commands/parse.rs`, and handlers under group-owned command areas, preserving
  the existing dispatch surface while reducing future `commands/mod.rs` churn.
- **Approval-rule source metadata (#1186/#2971).** Runtime API
  `approval.required` events now include optional `matched_rule` metadata when
  an execution-policy rule caused the prompt. Thanks @greyfreedom for the PR
  and @Ram9199 for the audit-semantics discussion.
- **Localized tool-family labels (#2901).** Tool activity labels for read,
  patch, run, find, delegate, fanout, RLM, verify, think, and generic tool
  work now route through the shipped locale tables. Thanks @gordonlu for the
  PR.
- **Localized config section labels (#2918).** The interactive config view now
  localizes section and session/saved scope labels while preserving English
  search terms. Thanks @gordonlu for the PR.
- **Localized config editor labels (#2919).** The config editor modal now
  localizes edit labels, default/unavailable placeholders, and effective
  currency hints. Thanks @gordonlu for the PR.
- **Hotbar number-key dispatch (#3056).** Bare `1`-`8` now trigger bound
  hotbar slots only when the composer is empty, while `Alt+1`-`Alt+8` trigger
  slots regardless of composer text and overlays keep key ownership. Thanks
  @reidliu41 for the PR.
- **Voice dictation commands (#3051).** `/voice`, `/voice-send`, and
  `/voice-control` now record through `sox`/`rec`/`arecord`, transcribe via the
  active provider's chat-completions API, and insert transcripts at the
  composer cursor. The `voice.toggle` hotbar action dispatches the real voice
  command, with help and status text localized across all seven shipped
  locales. Thanks @huqiantao for the PR.
- **Thread rewind and snapshot restore API (#2808).** GUI clients can now call
  `POST /v1/threads/{id}/undo`, `/patch-undo`, and `/retry` to fork, roll back,
  or rerun recent thread turns, plus `POST /v1/snapshots/{id}/restore` to
  restore a workspace snapshot by id. Thanks @bengao168 for the PR.
- **Active provider fallback chain (#2773).** Configured `fallback_providers`
  now build an ordered primary-plus-fallback route that the TUI can report,
  advance through, and reset with `/provider fallback reset`, including footer
  visibility for fallback state. Thanks @idling11 for the PR.
- **Provider metadata registry (#3005).** Built-in provider ids, display names,
  defaults, env vars, config keys, aliases, and wire formats now live in a
  shared metadata registry, with the provider drift check covering the registry
  contract. Thanks @sximelon for the PR.
- **Hugging Face provider route (#2879).** Hugging Face Inference Providers now
  have first-class config, env, docs, and registry coverage for the
  OpenAI-compatible router, including `huggingface`/`hugging-face`/
  `hugging_face`/`hf` aliases and `HUGGINGFACE_*`/`HF_*` env fallbacks. Thanks
  @mvanhorn for the PR.

### Fixed

- **SSE data lines without spaces (#3152).** Chat Completions, Responses, and
  Anthropic stream readers now accept both `data: {...}` and `data:{...}` SSE
  frames, matching the spec and preventing providers that omit the optional
  space from streaming empty output. Thanks @wgeeker for the PR.
- **Runtime thread detail N+1 reads (#3141).** `get_thread_detail` now scans
  persisted turn items once and groups them by turn instead of reading the
  items directory once per turn, preserving item order while keeping large
  thread detail loads responsive.
- **Project-local hook trust boundary (#3140).** `.codewhale/hooks.toml` is now
  loaded only after the workspace is trusted in user-owned config, matching the
  project-local MCP trust model while preserving the documented shell-command
  hook contract.
- **Skill registry sync latency (#3139).** `/skills sync` now syncs registry
  entries with bounded ordered concurrency, so network latency no longer stacks
  one skill at a time while output order stays deterministic.
- **SiliconFlow China provider config (#2893/#2895).** `siliconflow-CN`
  now reads its own `[providers.siliconflow_cn]` / `[providers.siliconflow-CN]`
  table and falls back to `[providers.siliconflow]` only for unset
  `api_key`/`base_url`/`model` fields. Thanks @Artenx for the report and
  @idling11 for the PR.
- **Self-update download timeout (#3006).** `codewhale update` now applies a
  five-minute HTTP client timeout so blocked or very slow GitHub release
  downloads fail instead of hanging indefinitely. Thanks @New2Niu for the PR.
- **Legacy `deepseek` update migration (#2960/#3013/#3053).** Running
  `deepseek update` or `deepseek-tui update` from a pre-rebrand install now
  returns copy-pasteable npm, Cargo, Homebrew, and manual-binary migration
  steps instead of trying to spawn a missing `codewhale` binary. README and
  rebrand docs now cover the same upgrade path. Thanks @jazzi and
  @tiangangQiu for the reports, @cyq1017 for the update-path PR, and
  @angus-guo for the README PR.
- **Short `codew` shim delegation.** The `codew` convenience binary now
  prefers the sibling `codewhale` dispatcher installed next to it before
  falling back to `PATH`, preventing fresh local builds or installs from
  accidentally invoking an older global dispatcher.
- **Constitution trust wording (#2950/#3008).** The base prompt now explains
  that "begins with an A" means a baseline of trust, not a literal output
  formatting rule. Thanks @cyq1017 for the PR.
- **TUI provider-source recovery (#3007/#3011).** Unsupported interactive
  providers now report whether the value came from `--provider`, environment,
  or config. Config-sourced unsupported providers fall back to DeepSeek without
  forwarding stale keyring secrets. Thanks @cyq1017 for the PR.
- **Exec auto-model handoff (#3148).** `codewhale exec --model auto` now
  survives the CLI/TUI boundary by honoring the CodeWhale model env alias and
  legacy DeepSeek model handoff before falling back to provider defaults.
  Thanks @hongchen1993 for the PR.
- **macOS shortcut modifiers (#2938/#2943).** Ctrl-like shortcuts that are
  reported as `SUPER` by macOS terminals now work for backgrounding tasks and
  sidebar-focus chords without rewriting clipboard shortcuts. Thanks @idling11
  for the PR.
- **TUI mouse-report leak (#3063/#3067).** Strip raw SGR mouse coordinate
  tails from the composer even when `use_mouse_capture` is false, covering
  orphaned terminal reporting state after crashes or focus races.
- **Interrupted sub-agent lifecycle (#3080).** API-timeout interruptions now
  emit `MailboxMessage::Interrupted`, render terminal interrupted cards, and
  reconcile stale running fanout counts from manager snapshots.
- **OpenAI Codex stream diagnostics and active tool collapse (#3146).** The
  Responses bridge now reports nested `response.failed` /
  `response.incomplete` errors instead of `unknown`, and dense successful
  in-flight tool bursts collapse into the same calm activity metadata row as
  committed history.
- **OpenAI Codex reasoning tiers.** Switching from DeepSeek to `openai-codex`
  now normalizes stale reasoning state into Responses-compatible
  `low`/`medium`/`high`/`xhigh` tiers. Startup, `/config`, and the model
  picker now display Codex labels instead of leaking DeepSeek
  `off`/`max` names, while Codex still reports as a Responses payload
  provider. The Responses request builder also clamps legacy `minimal` input
  to `low` and has regression coverage that Codex requests use
  `reasoning.effort`, not DeepSeek `thinking` fields.
- **OpenAI Codex context metadata (#3070).** The `gpt-5.5` default and
  CodeWhale aliases now use OpenAI's documented 1,050,000-token context window
  and 128,000 max-output metadata for context pressure, prompts, and doctor
  capability output.
- **OpenAI Codex effective context budgeting.** The public OpenAI API metadata
  for `gpt-5.5` remains 1,050,000 tokens, but the `openai-codex` OAuth route now
  budgets prompts against the 400K Codex-family effective window so preflight
  compaction runs before the backend returns `context_length_exceeded`.
- **OpenRouter Nemotron 3 Ultra preset.** The OpenRouter preset and model
  registry now emit `nvidia/nemotron-3-ultra-550b-a55b` while keeping the old
  Ultra aliases compatible.
- **OpenRouter auth after MiMo switches (#3064).** Switching from Xiaomi MiMo
  to OpenRouter now has regression coverage for preflight key failures and
  Bearer auth header isolation before any request can be dispatched.
- **Responses strict-tool schema compatibility (#3062/#3017/#1883).** Responses
  function tools now preserve per-tool strict-mode compatibility, keep optional
  strict-schema fields nullable, and append deterministic constraint notes when
  root composition groups must be flattened for Responses.
- **Runtime prompt autonomous loop guard (#3061).** Runtime policy reference
  now explicitly forbids initiating new work when `<runtime_prompt>` is the
  only new turn content and no tool/sub-agent handoff is pending.
- **Goal runtime status sync.** Goal token budgets and active/paused/complete
  status now sync into the engine alongside the objective, and model-visible
  `update_goal` can only mark goals complete or blocked.

## [0.8.58] - 2026-06-11

### Added

- **Native Anthropic provider.** A dedicated Messages API adapter
  (`/v1/messages` with `x-api-key` auth) replaces OpenAI-dialect shims for
  Claude models: adaptive thinking with `output_config.effort` shaping,
  prompt-cache breakpoints (capped at 4, earliest dropped), signed-thinking
  replay via `signature_delta`, normalized cache-hit/miss usage telemetry,
  and SSE error envelopes. `claude-opus-4-8`, `claude-sonnet-4-6`, and
  `claude-haiku-4-5` join the model registry; configure with
  `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (#3014).
- **Hooks v2.** `tool_call_before` hooks can now return a JSON decision —
  `{"decision": "allow"|"deny"|"ask", "reason", "updatedInput",
  "additionalContext"}` — with deny > ask > allow precedence across multiple
  hooks, last-writer-wins input rewriting, and concatenated context. Exit
  code 2 remains a legacy hard deny. Hooks support glob matchers and
  project-local `.codewhale/hooks.toml` (#3026).
- **Clickable sidebar.** Background-job rows show/cancel on click, the
  Ctrl+K hint row runs `/jobs cancel-all`, and agent rows open `/subagents`;
  row actions are built in the same pass as the rendered lines so a click
  can never target the wrong job (#3028).
- OSC 8 out-of-band hyperlink infrastructure with per-region open/close
  sequences that survive partial redraws (#3029).
- `codewhale exec` gains `--allowed-tools`, `--disallowed-tools` (deny wins),
  `--max-turns`, and `--append-system-prompt` (#3027).
- Constitution prompt source: YAML source-of-truth plus Python renderer for
  the system prompt, with the active prompt now served from
  `constitution.md` (#3015, renderer reconciliation still tracked).
- Agent-task issue template, labels, and runner protocol (#3021); remote
  smoke-test droplet loop hardening — gh CLI, swapfile, agent sessions
  (#3022).

### Changed

- **Sub-agent routing is provider-aware.** DeepSeek ids are no longer
  hardcoded into model validation; routing works from per-provider
  big/cheap candidates, the network router is skipped when a provider has
  no cheap tier, and spawn-time model requests are validated against the
  active provider (#3018).
- Model-specific facts in the system prompt (context window, sub-agent
  pricing, thinking notes, architecture characteristics) are now templated
  per-model instead of hardcoded DeepSeek V4 claims, in both `base.md` and
  `constitution.md` (#3025).
- Provider capability lookups for Moonshot/OpenAI/Atlascloud resolve from
  per-model registry rows (bare and vendor-prefixed ids) instead of
  hardcoded 64K-era floors (#3023).
- Reasoning-effort now reaches Atlascloud (DeepSeek dialect), Moonshot
  (`thinking` enable/disable), and Ollama (`think` param) (#3024); Moonshot/
  Kimi models joined the reasoning-content provider and model gates (#3016).
- Transcript polish: compact tool-call cells without boilerplate (#3031),
  internal turn/agent ids hidden behind stable labels (#3030), and Ctrl+B
  now backgrounds the running foreground shell directly instead of opening
  a menu (#3032).
- The Tasks sidebar separates "Model reasoning" from "Background commands",
  and `auth list` reports the same active-credential source as
  `auth status` for openai-codex.

### Fixed

- **TUI freeze under sub-agent load.** Rapid `AgentProgress` events
  saturated the render loop and starved terminal input; progress-driven
  repaints are now throttled to one per 100ms (#3033).
- **Hooks on Windows.** Hook commands were passed to `cmd /C` through
  CRT-style argument quoting, which injected literal `\"` sequences that
  cmd.exe never unescapes — JSON decisions could not parse. Commands now
  reach cmd.exe verbatim via `raw_arg`.
- Codex Responses: assistant tool results are converted to
  `function_call_output` items (multi-turn tool calling previously broke),
  tool schemas are sanitized for the Responses API, and `maximum` effort
  maps to `xhigh` (#3019, #3017 — both partially; retry/backoff and
  per-tool strict mode remain open).
- Better tool-denial and provider error messages harvested from PR #2933
  (#3020).


## [0.8.57] - 2026-06-10

### Added

- **Turns now survive system sleep.** When the host suspends mid-stream, the
  connection used to die on wake with `Stream read error: error decoding
  response body` and the turn was lost (#2990). The engine now stamps stream
  progress with both monotonic and wall-clock time; a large divergence on a
  stream error identifies a sleep/wake cycle, and the request is silently
  re-issued (up to the existing 3-retry budget) instead of failing the turn.
- **One-command release prep.** `./scripts/release/prepare-release.sh X.Y.Z`
  bumps the workspace version, every internal crate dependency pin, the npm
  wrapper, and the README install-tag examples, refreshes `Cargo.lock`,
  regenerates the embedded TUI changelog slice and web facts, and runs
  `check-versions.sh` — the v0.8.56 release needed nine follow-up commits for
  exactly these sync points.
- `.github/CODEOWNERS` and `.github/dependabot.yml` (weekly cargo +
  github-actions updates, monthly npm for `web/`).

### Changed

- **The changelog went on a diet.** Root `CHANGELOG.md` now carries recent
  releases (v0.8.40+); older entries moved to `docs/CHANGELOG_ARCHIVE.md`.
  `crates/tui/CHANGELOG.md` — embedded into every binary for `/change` — is a
  generated 15-release slice (`scripts/sync-changelog.sh`), no longer a
  357 KB manual byte-for-byte copy (~300 KB smaller binaries).
- GitHub Release bodies are generated from the tagged version's changelog
  section (`scripts/release/generate-release-body.sh`) instead of a
  hardcoded workflow blob with a hand-pasted contributor list.
- `check-versions.sh` now also gates `web/lib/facts.generated.ts` and the
  README install-tag examples; the CNB mirror pipeline validates the pushed
  tag against `Cargo.toml` before generating release notes.
- Docs reorganized: internal design notes moved under `docs/rfcs/`; stale
  internal docs (old audits, handoffs, region-specific VM notes) removed.
- Agent-facing polish: the system prompt environment block reports
  `codewhale_version` (was `deepseek_version`), the legacy
  `.deepseek/instructions.md` path is no longer advertised in the prompt
  (still honored for back-compat), and oversized instruction files are
  truncated with an explicit `[…truncated: N bytes omitted]` marker instead
  of a bare ellipsis.

### Fixed

- **Docker images build again.** The release `docker` job failed for v0.8.56
  because the Dockerfile still copied the pre-rebrand `deepseek` /
  `deepseek-tui` binaries; they are now symlinks to the codewhale binaries
  inside the image, so legacy container entrypoints keep working.
- `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` used the pre-rebrand container name,
  mount path, and `deepseek` remote user.
- Stale `--bin deepseek` examples, `DeepSeek-TUI` strings in `/change`
  output, and pre-rebrand doc comments.

- Google Gemini is its own backend (`/provider google`) on the official
  OpenAI-compatible route with thought-signature capture/replay and
  fail-closed replay for thinking models. Antigravity (`agy` 1.1.13) joins
  as a separate credential-plane provider: consent-gated read-only import
  of the official CLI's login with `ANTIGRAVITY_API_KEY`/`AGY_ADC_AUTH`
  precedence; requests fail closed until the cloud-code wire protocol is
  implemented.

### Removed

- Unused dependencies: `tracing-appender` and `zeroize` (TUI crate),
  `rustls` (release crate); the orphaned `vendor/schemaui-0.12.0` lockfile
  leftover and a machine-specific one-off `scripts/verify_task.sh`.

## [0.8.56] - 2026-06-09

### Added

- **Status picker localization.** The status picker surface (7 MessageIds) is
  now localized across all supported locales (#2896, @gordonlu).
- **Approval dialog localization.** The approval dialog surface is now
  localized across 7 locales: English, Simplified Chinese, Japanese,
  Vietnamese, Portuguese, Spanish, and French (#2891, @gordonlu).
- **Volcengine provider in TUI dispatcher.** The `codewhale` / `codewhale-tui`
  CLI dispatcher now allows the Volcengine provider, so users can launch
  directly into a Volcengine-backed session (#2923, @hongchen1993).
- **Dispatcher API-key preference.** When a provider-specific API key is
  supplied via the CLI dispatcher, it is now preferred over the saved root
  key, fixing a regression where saved keys masked explicit CLI keys (#2928,
  @hongchen1993).
- **Qwen 3.6 Plus model support.** Added complete Qwen 3.6 Plus model
  resolution with dedicated version-bump tests (#2930, @idling11).
- **Oversized paste spill.** Pastes larger than ~10 KB are now written to
  `.codewhale/pastes/` instead of being truncated or dropped, preserving the
  full content for the session (#2920, @sximelon).
- **Cross-session prompt cache.** Added a disk-backed cross-session prompt
  base-section cache so post-mode-flip and post-restart turns reuse the
  byte-stable prefix without rebuilding it from scratch.

### Fixed

- **Background shell routing.** Shell commands expected to take >5 seconds are
  now automatically guided to background tasks instead of blocking the agent
  loop, with the task panel syncing immediately on cancel (#2947, #2941,
  @cyq1017, @idling11).
- **`allow_shell` error naming.** Shell-tool refusal errors now explicitly name
  `allow_shell = false` as the reason and suggest `/config allow_shell true` as
  the escape hatch (#2905, @cyq1017).
- **Prefix-cache stability across mode flips.** `allow_shell` is now decoupled
  from the static system-prompt prefix, so mode changes (Plan ↔ Agent ↔ YOLO)
  no longer rebuild the byte-stable message[0] and invalidate the DeepSeek
  prefix cache (#2949, @LeoAlex0).
- **`visibility="internal"` explained.** The Runtime Policy Reference section
  of the system prompt now explains the `visibility="internal"` attribute so
  models stop narrating their current mode between steps (#2951, @LeoAlex0).
- **Bocha web search response handling.** Updated response parsing for the
  Bocha search backend after an upstream API change (#2946, @h3c-hexin).
- **PDF read hang.** Full-PDF reads now use `extract_text_by_pages` to avoid
  a hang on large or complex PDFs (#2898, @idling11).
- **9 critical bugs.** Fixed bugs across tools, client, and commands: stale
  `ContentBlockStop` cleanup, missing `#[test]` attribute, trailing-space
  restoration on English `ApprovalField` labels, and several
  correctness/stability issues (#2880, @HUQIANTAO).

### Changed

- **CNB shim cleanup.** Removed deprecated `deepseek` shim references from the
  CNB mirror path.
- **Style.** Applied `cargo fmt` to `crates/tools/src/file.rs`.

## [0.8.55] - 2026-06-08

### Added

- **Together AI provider.** Added Together AI as a first-class provider
  (`[providers.together]`, `TOGETHER_API_KEY`/`TOGETHER_BASE_URL`/`TOGETHER_MODEL`)
  with default models `deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V4-Pro` and
  `deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V4-Flash`, TUI provider-picker/auth/capability support,
  and CLI `auth list`/`auth status` coverage.
- **Model catalog updates.** Added Qwen 3.7 Max (`qwen/qwen3.7-max`), MiniMax 2.7
  (`minimax/minimax-m2.7`), and NVIDIA Nemotron 3 Ultra (`nvidia/nemotron-3-ultra`)
  on OpenRouter.
- **OpenAI Codex (ChatGPT) provider — experimental.** Added an `openai-codex`
  provider that reuses an existing ChatGPT/Codex CLI OAuth login. The access
  token is read and refreshed from `~/.codex/auth.json` (no API key is stored),
  and requests use the OpenAI Responses API at `/codex/responses` with the
  `chatgpt-account-id` header and `responses=experimental` beta opt-in. Env
  overrides: `OPENAI_CODEX_ACCESS_TOKEN`/`CODEX_ACCESS_TOKEN`,
  `OPENAI_CODEX_BASE_URL`/`CODEX_BASE_URL`, `OPENAI_CODEX_MODEL`/`CODEX_MODEL`,
  `OPENAI_CODEX_ACCOUNT_ID`/`CODEX_ACCOUNT_ID`, `OPENAI_CODEX_AUTH_FILE`,
  `CODEX_HOME`. Default model `gpt-5.5`. The live Responses round-trip has not
  been exercised against the production backend in CI; treat as preview.

## [0.8.54] - 2026-06-08

### Added

- Added `/restore list [N]` so users can inspect more side-git rollback
  snapshots with UTC timestamps before choosing a restore point. Plain
  `/restore` now shows the 20 most recent snapshots, numeric restore targets can
  reach beyond that default listing up to a bounded index, and list requests
  above the visible cap fail explicitly instead of silently truncating.
- Added HarmonyOS/OpenHarmony support scaffolding: environment-driven
  `OHOS_NATIVE_SDK` setup scripts and compiler wrappers, platform docs,
  explicit Rustls ring-provider installation for the no-provider TLS build, and
  OHOS fallbacks for unsupported keyring, clipboard, sandbox, browser-open, TTY,
  execpolicy Starlark parsing, and self-update surfaces.
- Added `scripts/release/check-ohos-deps.sh` and wired it into CI/release
  preflight so the OpenHarmony target graph fails if unsupported `nix`,
  `portable-pty`, `starlark`, `arboard`, or `keyring` dependencies re-enter.
- Added `.github/AUTHOR_MAP` and a CI co-author credit check so harvested
  commits use GitHub-mappable numeric noreply identities instead of `.local`,
  placeholder, bot/tool, or raw third-party emails.
- Added a `turn_end` observer hook that fires after post-turn TUI state and
  token totals are updated. Hooks receive structured JSON with status, usage,
  totals, duration, tool count, and queued-message count on stdin; stdout is
  ignored and failures are warn-only (#1364, #2578).
- Added provider-scoped `insecure_skip_tls_verify` for private
  OpenAI-compatible gateways that cannot use a trusted CA bundle. The setting is
  disabled by default, applies only to the active LLM provider HTTP client, and
  is surfaced by `codewhale doctor`; `SSL_CERT_FILE` remains the preferred path
  for corporate or private CA roots. Thanks @wavezhang for the original #1893
  direction.
- Added a default-disabled hard-compaction planner that can identify the
  summarizable middle of a long conversation while preserving the recent tail,
  existing tool-call/result pair guarantees, and working-set pinning. This
  harvests the safe planning layer from #2522 without enabling hard compaction
  or adding a message-rewrite execution path yet. Thanks @HUQIANTAO for the
  proposal.
- Added rich PlanArtifact support to `update_plan`: Plan mode can now carry
  grounded objectives, context, sources, critical files, constraints,
  verification, risks, and handoff notes through the transcript card, Plan
  confirmation prompt, `/relay`, fork-state, and saved-session replay.
- Added the first `codewhale-whaleflow` foundation crate with typed workflow
  config/IR validation and deterministic phase ordering tests. This preserves
  the WhaleFlow direction from #2482/#2486 without exposing a runtime
  `workflow_run` tool until cancellation, replay, and worktree semantics are
  release-safe. The foundation now includes explicit `WorkflowSpec`,
  `WorkflowNode`, branch/leaf/policy metadata structs, plus serializable branch,
  leaf, and control-node result records toward the #2668 TraceStore contract.
  It also adds a crate-local mock executor skeleton for Sequence, BranchSet,
  Leaf, Reduce, LoopUntil, Cond, Expand, BranchTournament, and ParetoFrontier
  control flow so #2669 can progress without spawning agents, applying
  worktrees, or exposing a `workflow_run` runtime tool yet. A first Starlark
  authoring layer now compiles fail-closed model-authored workflow files into
  that typed IR, with `rlm_cache_change.star` and `issue_fix_tournament.star`
  examples plus a one-pass repair for common `ctx.*` authoring aliases (#2670).
  Leaf, branch, and workflow execution results now carry deterministic token
  and cost telemetry fields that the mock executor can aggregate without live
  provider calls or runtime sub-agent fanout (#2486). The mock executor now
  carries crate-local cancellation and budget-exhaustion status markers so the
  branch/leaf runtime contract can be tested before live workflow execution is
  exposed (#2669). A crate-only replay executor now evaluates workflows from
  recorded leaf/control records, computes
  stable SHA-256 leaf input hashes, and marks missing records as
  `replay_diverged` instead of calling models again (#2673); the runtime replay
  command and live-provider replay fallback remain deferred. The crate also now
  has a model-agnostic role/capability registry with mock provider plumbing and
  fail-closed JSON repair parsing, so WhaleFlow can choose capable models for
  roles without hardcoding provider-specific runtime paths (#2672). The
  `rlm_cache_change.star` dogfood workflow now exercises candidate branches,
  LoopUntil verification, tournament selection, teacher review, and mock
  execution in CI-oriented crate tests (#2679). Leaf, branch, and workflow
  results now also carry separate ARMH/shared-memo and provider prompt-cache
  telemetry counters, with mock aggregation tests, so #2671 can progress
  without wiring live RLM calls or billing-affecting provider behavior yet. The
  Starlark and typed-IR gates now also reject unknown leaf dependencies,
  reducer inputs, and teacher-review candidates before mock execution or replay,
  keeping generated workflows fail-closed while runtime/worktree semantics stay
  deferred. TeacherReview now has serializable GEPA-style candidate artifacts
  for notes, workflow recipes, skills, regression tests, cache policy, branch
  heuristics, and Starlark authoring prompt patches, plus an offline helper
  that proposes candidates from recorded execution traces without promoting
  them or training model weights (#2674). StudentReplay results can now be
  stored on teacher candidates, and a deterministic PromotionGate compares
  baseline-vs-candidate replay deltas, required tests, policy violations,
  staleness, and cost constraints before marking a candidate promotable (#2675).
  The external-memory cutline now documents that Aleph-style memory stays
  optional, explicit, visible, and clear/export-capable for v0.9.0 rather than
  becoming a hidden default context substrate (#2677).
  A dedicated v0.9.0 release acceptance matrix now tracks provider, runtime,
  UI, WhaleFlow, Model Lab, remote-workbench, docs, rollback, and credit gates
  that must be checked or explicitly deferred before tagging (#2729).
  HarnessProfile docs now pin the v0.9.0 order: posture/schema/resolver/seed
  profiles/status display must precede evidence stores, promotion gates, or any
  automatic Harness Creator, with DeepSeek, MiMo, Arcee, and generic/HF/local
  posture expectations called out separately (#2728).
  Hugging Face / Model Lab and `codebase_search` release gates now explicitly
  ship only the provider/MCP/docs/design foundation in v0.9; native Hub search,
  model passports, Spaces/Jobs workflows, eval/export surfaces, and runtime
  `codebase_search` registration remain deferred (#2705, #2680, #2727).
  Remote workbench acceptance is also marked docs/setup-only for v0.9 so release
  notes do not imply a shipped VM or Telegram bridge runtime (#2724).
  Release-facing HarnessProfile docs now match the current implementation:
  v0.9 ships the typed schema/config foundation and defers runtime resolver,
  telemetry, seed-profile selection, and status-display behavior until later
  verified slices. `config.example.toml` includes a commented dormant
  harness-profile example, and README links point at the real acceptance matrix
  and HarnessProfile cutline docs.
  The release acceptance matrix now records evidence for already-landed gates:
  provider-registry drift checks, provider-scoped TLS skip verify, read-only
  GUI runtime/restore-point surfaces, VS Code Agent View branch visibility,
  WhaleFlow mock/runtime foundations, explicit external-memory boundaries, and
  docs alignment. Live workflow execution, provider calls, TraceStore writes,
  and mutation-oriented GUI endpoints remain deferred until their atomicity and
  replay contracts are tested. The `rlm_cache_change.star` dogfood workflow can
  now be replayed from recorded mock leaf/control records, and missing dogfood
  records produce `ReplayDiverged` instead of falling back to live execution
  (#2679). The UI/workflow UX rows now also distinguish shipped transcript
  tool-run collapse, sidebar detail popovers, and PlanArtifact review/handoff
  evidence from the deferred first-look/home redesign, and record focused
  slash-picker readability smoke coverage for visibility, selection, skill
  insertion, Esc priority, and stable composer height (#2692, #2694, #2691,
  #2713).
  Thanks @AdityaVG13 for the WhaleFlow draft and cost-tracking direction.
- Added a state-store v2 schema migration for WhaleFlow trace tables covering
  workflow, branch, leaf, control-node, and teacher-candidate runs. The
  migration creates persistence shape only; workflow execution and replay
  remain deferred until the runtime semantics are safe (#2668).
- Added an official VS Code extension Phase 0 scaffold with terminal launch,
  local runtime attach checks, status bar state, and a read-only Agent View
  preview backed by recent runtime thread summaries, plus a read-only
  `GET /v1/snapshots` endpoint for GUI clients to inspect side-git restore
  points. The extension now renders those restore points read-only in its Agent
  View, and thread summaries include read-only workspace, branch, current Git
  head, and dirty-state metadata so the VS Code Agent View can show when a
  thread or agent lane is on another branch or has changed worktree state. Agent
  View and restore-point data now auto-refresh on a configurable
  read-only interval so branch/workspace/status changes become visible without a
  manual refresh. Agent View refreshes keep thread branch/workspace rows
  independent from restore-point loading, so a snapshot-listing failure no
  longer clears already-available thread metadata. This answers the VS Code GUI
  lane without exposing chat webviews, inline edits, or retry/undo/restore
  runtime mutation endpoints yet
  (#461, #462, #480, #1217, #2341, #1584, #2327, #2580, #2808). Thanks @AiurArtanis
  for the Agent View prompt, @lbcheng888 for the earlier scaffold, @gaord for
  the GUI runtime API direction, @douglarek, @caeserchen, and @nightt5879 for
  the branch visibility trail, and @BigBenLabs, @lzx1545642258, @yangdaowan,
  @mangdehuang, @VerrPower, @hejia-v, @nasus9527, and @ygzhang-cn for the
  GUI/VS Code demand and validation trail.
- Added inline live-output refresh for background shell Exec cards keyed by the
  exact shell task id, so long-running commands can show bounded stdout/stderr
  tails without consuming deltas or matching by command text. Thanks
  @donglovejava for the live shell-output direction in #2048.
- Added a static prompt composer override for embedders that need to replace
  the byte-stable base/personality prompt segment while leaving mode metadata,
  approval policy, tool taxonomy, Context Management, and the Compaction Relay
  under CodeWhale's runtime prompt assembly. This refines the embedder prompt
  customization path from #2786 without weakening prompt-continuity safeguards.
  Thanks @h3c-hexin.
- Added `POST /v1/sessions` for runtime clients to save a completed thread as a
  managed session. The endpoint preserves thread title/model/mode/workspace
  metadata, maps missing threads to 404, and returns 409 instead of snapshotting
  queued or active turns.
- Added cost-estimate pricing for the Xiaomi MiMo primary chat models, which
  were previously unpriced: `mimo-v2.5-pro` / `xiaomi/mimo-v2.5-pro` reuse the
  DeepSeek V4-Pro rate table and `mimo-v2.5` / `xiaomi/mimo-v2.5` reuse the
  DeepSeek V4-Flash rates. Existing DeepSeek pricing is unchanged (#2731, #2750).
- Added a metadata-only `codewhale-config` provider registry with canonical
  lookup, alias-aware resolution, provider defaults, config-table keys, and
  API-key env candidates. Runtime routing remains unchanged and fallback
  providers stay dormant; this harvests the safe provider-trait foundation from
  #2479 toward #2075. Thanks @sximelon.
- Added optional `[search].base_url` / `CODEWHALE_SEARCH_BASE_URL` support for
  DuckDuckGo-compatible private search endpoints, while keeping
  `DEEPSEEK_SEARCH_BASE_URL` as a legacy alias. Custom endpoints are gated by
  their configured host, do not fall back to public Bing, and report the custom
  host as the result source for diagnostics (#2436, #2510).
- Added `completion_sound = "file"` with `[notifications].sound_file` so
  Windows users can play a custom WAV file for turn-completion sounds without
  changing the global Windows sound scheme (#2484, #2512).
- Added `[tui].stream_chunk_timeout_secs` and `/config stream_chunk_timeout_secs`
  so slow local or OpenAI-compatible model servers can extend the SSE idle
  timeout without mutating process environment. The legacy
  `DEEPSEEK_STREAM_IDLE_TIMEOUT_SECS` env var remains a fallback (#2365, #2507).
- Added dormant `fallback_providers = [...]` config parsing plus a provider-chain
  helper for future fallback routing. This preserves the requested contract
  without enabling silent runtime provider switches yet (#2574, #2777). Thanks
  @hsdbeebou for the request and @idling11 for the data-model draft.
- Added `/hf` with `/huggingface` alias for Hugging Face MCP status/setup
  helpers and `/hf concepts` provider/MCP/Hub guidance. The helper points users
  to Hugging Face's settings-generated MCP configuration and intentionally does
  not include Hub search, direct Hugging Face HTTP requests, or upload behavior
  (#2709, #2782). Thanks @idling11 for the original Hugging Face MCP draft.
- Added an in-process response cache for deterministic non-streaming,
  tool-free chat requests. The cache is keyed by provider, base URL, path
  suffix, API-key fingerprint, and final wire body, and zeroes usage on hits so
  local spend counters are not double-counted (#2501). Thanks @HUQIANTAO for
  the response-cache proposal and canonical-body key update.
- Added `/sidebar` so users can toggle, show, hide, and optionally persist the
  TUI sidebar from the command line instead of relying on copy-hostile sidebar
  state during long transcript work (#2766, #2788). Thanks @mo-vic for the
  detailed report and @aboimpinto for the fix.
- Added a pausable custom slash-command MVP: commands with `pausable: true`
  can pause before further tool execution, preserve the paused command while
  separate messages are handled, and resume only on explicit continue/resume
  wording. Harvested from #2732 with thanks to @aboimpinto.
- Added Sofya (`provider = "sofya"`) as a search-tool backend with
  `SOFYA_API_KEY` fallback, while keeping Sofya scoped to web search rather
  than model-provider routing (#2790). Thanks @yusufgurdogan for the
  implementation.
- Added Xiaomi MiMo `mode` / `XIAOMI_MIMO_MODE` / `MIMO_MODE` selection for
  Token Plan region endpoints and pay-as-you-go routing, plus dedicated Token
  Plan env keys for `tp-*` subscriptions (#2621, #2627). Thanks @springeye for
  the request and @xyuai for the implementation.
- Added the first TUI hotbar action registry foundation so future UI controls
  can dispatch typed app actions instead of growing another command match
  surface (#2866). Thanks @reidliu41 for the implementation.
- Added the narrow multi-tab core and persistence foundation, including tab
  manager snapshots, delegation/group restore counters, mention parsing,
  cross-tab events, and corruption-tolerant persisted state, while leaving the
  broader collaboration UI wiring to follow-up work (#2864). Thanks
  @ljm3790865 for the tab-core implementation and #2753 direction.
- The VS Code Agent View now renders the runtime thread summary's Git `head`
  and dirty-worktree flag alongside branch metadata, keeping branch switches
  visible without adding retry/undo/restore mutation endpoints yet (#2580,
  #2862). Thanks @AiurArtanis and @nasus9527 for the IDE/agent-view requests
  and @gaord for the runtime metadata direction.

### Changed

- Removed the deprecated `deepseek` and `deepseek-tui` binary shims from the
  v0.9.0 Cargo crates and GitHub release artifact matrix. The canonical
  `codewhale`, `codew`, and `codewhale-tui` entry points remain, the private
  deprecated `npm/deepseek-tui` notice package stays unpublished, and DeepSeek
  provider/model/env/config compatibility remains first-class.
- Command-adjacent config persistence and auto model routing now live in
  neutral TUI modules instead of command-owned files, reducing command-boundary
  coupling while preserving current `/config`, `/model`, UI, runtime, and
  sub-agent behavior (#2871). Thanks @aboimpinto for landing this first staged
  command-boundary layer from the broader #2851/#2791 design direction.
- `/config` now reports the canonical `~/.codewhale/settings.toml` path for TUI
  settings while still reading legacy DeepSeek-branded settings fallbacks and
  migrating them into the CodeWhale home on load.
- Provider switches now roll back transactionally when the first request to a
  newly selected provider fails authentication: CodeWhale restores the previous
  provider/model, model-ID passthrough, onboarding/API-key state, runtime
  config, persisted provider selection, and engine handle so users can return
  to DeepSeek after a failed Moonshot/Kimi switch (#2754, #2755). Thanks
  @Dr3259 for the Windows repro and @cyq1017 for the draft fix.
- `PATCH /v1/threads/{id}` can now update a thread's persisted workspace for
  GUI/runtime clients. Workspace changes reject active turns and evict idle
  cached engines so the next turn starts in the new workspace.
- Split `web_run` session/page cache state so cached page reads use shared
  page handles and do not serialize through the mutation path. The harvest also
  adds panic-safe state write-back and serializes cache-mutating unit tests so
  the global web cache remains stable under normal Cargo test parallelism.
- Appended volatile `<turn_meta>` blocks after user text in outgoing user
  message content arrays so provider prefix caches can keep matching the stable
  user-input prefix across date, route, and working-set changes.
- Projected mode, approval, and tool-taxonomy prompt metadata per request
  instead of mutating stored system prompts, keeping provider prefix-cache
  inputs byte-stable while preserving mode-specific instructions (#2687).
  Thanks @LeoAlex0 for the implementation.
- Softened contribution intake automation: external issues now receive a warm
  triage note and are never auto-closed by the contribution gate, while the PR
  gate copy makes clear that dry-run observations are about maintainer safety,
  not contributor quality.
- Added a PR gate marker guard so reopened unapproved PRs do not get duplicate
  intake comments, and clarified that PR reopening should happen after
  allowlist approval is merged.
- Ollama `/model` completions no longer show hosted DeepSeek API model IDs.
  The picker preserves the current or saved local Ollama tag, and users can
  still fetch installed model IDs through `/models` instead of relying on a
  stale static default (#2742). Thanks @reidliu41 for the focused report and
  draft fix.
- MCP runtime API tool listings and approval summaries no longer split
  underscored MCP server names at the first `_`. Tool-call routing already used
  the longest registered server name; the list endpoint now reuses that parser,
  and approval cards show the full MCP target route instead of a guessed server
  segment (#2744). Thanks @lioryx, @cyq1017, and @puneetdixit200 for the report
  and matching fixes.
- Documented the agent and sub-agent stewardship ethos so future automation
  preserves human issue intake, careful PR review, and contributor credit.
- Moved the TUI Starlark execpolicy parser and PTY support behind non-OHOS
  target dependencies so published OpenHarmony builds no longer pull `nix` 0.28
  through `rustyline` or `portable-pty`.
- Explicit `skills_dir` configuration is now unioned with workspace skill
  discovery instead of being shadowed by workspace-local skills, and configured
  skills take precedence over global defaults when prompt space is constrained.
- Tool-agent sub-agent routing now inherits the parent session model, or an
  explicit tool-agent override, instead of hard-coding `deepseek-v4-flash`;
  the fast lane still disables thinking through provider-aware request shaping.
- Dense successful read/search/list tool runs now collapse into a single
  expandable transcript row by default, while running, failed, shell, patch,
  review, diff, and other risky tool cells remain visible. The setting
  `tool_collapse = "compact" | "expanded" | "calm"` controls the behavior.
- Pending-input preview rows now label delivery mode explicitly as steer
  pending, rejected steer, or queued follow-up, with wrapped continuation rows
  aligned under the label so busy-turn input state is easier to read (#2054).
- Editing a queued follow-up is now an explicit pending-input state. Pressing
  `Esc` while editing a queued follow-up restores the original queued message
  instead of cancelling the active turn or silently dropping the queued work
  (#2054).
- Approval prompts now render prominent command, directory, file, path, or
  target rows before falling back to raw JSON params. Shell approvals preserve
  long command tails, split common shell chains for review, and show compact
  `printf > file` previews while keeping intent summaries visible (#1991,
  #2269).
- Sidebar hover details now use row-level metadata for truncated Work, Tasks,
  and Agents rows. Mouse hover opens a bordered, wrapping popover with the full
  underlying row text, long turn/agent ids, and current sub-agent progress
  instead of repeating the already-ellipsized sidebar label (#2694, #2734).
- Sub-agents now preserve checkpoint metadata around long model calls. A
  per-step API timeout marks the child as interrupted with a continuable
  checkpoint instead of ending as a null failed result, and `agent_eval` can
  explicitly continue a live checkpointed interrupted child while normal
  completed/failed/cancelled follow-up behavior stays unchanged (#2029).
- Durable task recovery no longer requeues tasks that were `running` when the
  previous CodeWhale process exited. On restart those records are marked failed
  with a recovery note, and any running tool-call summaries are marked failed
  too, so stale shell/task state cannot silently become live work again (#1786).
- Auto-generated project instructions now reuse the bounded Project Context
  Pack data instead of running an unbounded summary/tree scan when no
  `.codewhale/instructions.md` file exists. The fallback keeps later
  top-level folders visible in noisy large workspaces while the dynamic
  `<project_context_pack>` marker remains controlled by its own setting
  (#697, #1827).
- Project context loading now uses a bounded process-local content-signature
  cache for repeated hot-path loads. The cache covers workspace/parent
  instructions, global AGENTS/WHALE fallbacks, repo constitution files,
  generated-context targets, trust markers, and trust config paths, and it
  stores post-load signatures so auto-generated context deletion/regeneration
  stays correct (#2636).
- Configuration docs now show the provider-local `path_suffix` escape hatch
  for OpenAI-compatible gateways that accept `/chat/completions` but reject
  `/v1/chat/completions`, while making clear that model listing and DeepSeek
  beta routes keep their built-in paths (#1874).
- The config crate now carries the v0.9 HarnessPosture data model:
  `HarnessPosture`, `HarnessProfile`, and typed posture/compaction/tool/safety
  enums. The schema rejects misspelled posture names or unknown profile keys
  instead of silently falling back to `custom`; a pure resolver can match
  provider/model routes for tests and future status plumbing, while runtime
  provider/model posture selection remains a follow-up (#2693, #2741, #2728).

### Fixed

- **MiMo default tests.** Guarded Xiaomi MiMo default-model tests against ambient CI provider environment variables.
- Stream/body decode failures such as `Stream read error: error decoding
  response body` are now classified as recoverable network interruptions
  instead of generic internal errors, keeping the transcript and triage metadata
  aligned with the existing stream retry path (#2847). Thanks
  @qamranmushtaq-collab for the Windows/npx DeepSeek report.
- The TUI footer, `/status`, `/mcp` manager, and command-palette MCP entries
  now count trusted workspace-local `.codewhale/mcp.json` servers together with
  the global MCP config, matching `codewhale mcp list` for merged global +
  project setups (#2787). Thanks @yekern for the detailed reproduction.
- AltGr key chords in the composer no longer get swallowed by sidebar shortcuts
  on AZERTY and other international layouts, so characters such as `@`, `#`,
  `$`, `!`, and `%` can be entered normally (#2863, #2867). Thanks
  @ousamabenyounes for the fix and report.
- Sub-agent shell completions now refresh the workspace branch/status chip
  immediately, and `/subagents` plus the Agents sidebar show each sub-agent's
  current workspace branch when it is running in a child worktree.
- Authentication failures now include redacted request context such as provider,
  base URL authority, model, key source, key type, and key fingerprint, making
  stale provider, endpoint, or API-key state diagnosable without exposing the
  secret (#2665, #2792). Thanks @mvanhorn for the implementation.
- Browser-opening actions now compile on non-desktop targets by delegating the
  unsupported-platform error to the shared URL opener instead of hiding the TUI
  wrapper behind a narrower macOS/Linux/Windows cfg. Thanks @ci4ic4 for the
  NetBSD/pkgsrc packaging report and fix (#2789).
- MCP tool routing now preserves server names that contain underscores.
  `parse_prefixed_name` matches the qualified `mcp_<server>_<tool>` name against
  the set of registered server names and prefers the longest match, so tools on
  a server like `my_db` are reachable and an overlapping `my` / `my_db` pair
  routes correctly. Falls back to the legacy first-underscore split when no
  registered server matches (#2744).
- Schema-hydrated deferred tools no longer render as a completed run. The first
  use of a deferred tool returns a schema-hydration result instead of executing;
  the transcript and sidebar now show "tool loaded — retry required" via a
  dedicated hydrated status, so it is no longer indistinguishable from a real
  successful execution. A hydrated row also ranks with active work rather than
  completed successes (#2648).
- `codewhale sessions` now shows `codewhale resume <session-id>` in the footer
  instead of the invalid dispatcher command `codewhale --resume <session-id>`
  (#2758, #2760).
- TUI HTTP clients now install the Rustls ring crypto provider before building
  `reqwest` clients, covering engine, runtime API, tool, MCP, config, and skill
  download paths. This keeps the no-provider TLS build from panicking during
  tests or embedded startup paths that do not enter through the main binary.
- Prompt byte-stability tests now pin their temporary home and skills
  environment under the shared test-env lock so global skill directories cannot
  perturb deterministic prompt bytes during parallel test runs.

## [0.8.53] - 2026-06-03

### Added

- **Hugging Face Inference Providers.** Added `huggingface` as a native
  provider route (`/provider huggingface`). Supports `HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY`
  or `HF_TOKEN` for auth, `HUGGINGFACE_BASE_URL` and `HUGGINGFACE_MODEL`
  for overrides, and `deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V4-Pro` / `deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V4-Flash`
  as default models. Org-prefixed model IDs pass through.

### Fixed

- **Agent-mode shell error copy.** The missing-tool error for shell tools
  now directs users to `allow_shell = true` instead of nudging toward YOLO
  mode. `/config` surfaces `allow_shell` in the Permissions section.
- **Provider description.** `/provider` command description is now neutral
  instead of recommending specific providers.

### Community

Thanks to **@xyuai** for provider persistence, `/logout` scope clarification,
provider picker key replacement, and MiMo auth cleanup work (#2714, #2715,
#2717, #2718), and **@RefuseOdd** for configurable `path_suffix` support on
OpenAI-compatible endpoints (#2558).

## [0.8.52] - 2026-06-03

### Added

- **SiliconFlow China region provider.** Added the `siliconflow-CN` provider
  variant for the China regional endpoint, sharing the existing
  `[providers.siliconflow]` credentials and `SILICONFLOW_API_KEY` slot
  instead of creating a second credential namespace; the provider picker and
  registry docs now expose the regional route explicitly (#2588, #2615).
- **Multimodal `/attach` image forwarding.** Attached images are now sent as
  OpenAI-compatible `image_url` content blocks so multimodal providers can
  actually see image attachments (#2584, #2587, #2607).
- **Sub-agent lifecycle hooks and runtime metadata.** Sub-agent spawn/complete
  hook events, mode-change runtime messages, mode metadata on turns, localized
  context-inspector strings, and drag-to-resize sidebar width are included in
  this release slice.

### Fixed

- **Sub-agents now auto-cancel after stale heartbeats.** Running sub-agents
  track manager-visible progress and are auto-cancelled after the configurable
  `[subagents] heartbeat_timeout_secs` window (default 300s), releasing their
  concurrency slot and unblocking parent turns that would otherwise wait
  forever (#2603, #2614, #2620).
- **Work panel state survives transient lock misses.** The sidebar caches the
  last successful Work summary so checklist and strategy progress no longer
  disappear into "Work state updating..." while the engine briefly owns the
  shared todo/plan locks (#2606, #2616).
- **SiliconFlow-CN no longer breaks main.** Filled the missing CLI provider
  exhaustiveness arms and removed the duplicate/unreachable TUI config arms
  left by the #2615 landing; direct auth now stores the China-region variant in
  the shared SiliconFlow provider table (#2616, #2618, #2619).
- **v0.8.51 image-attach closure corrected.** The `/attach` multimodal fix
  landed after the v0.8.51 tag, so this release is the first version that
  actually contains it for users installing from the published release line
  (#2584, #2607).
- **Legacy SSE MCP reconnects are retryable again.** Closed or reset
  `POST /messages` requests on stale legacy SSE sessions now trigger the same
  reconnect-and-retry path as closed SSE streams, removing a release-gate flake
  and matching the intended recovery behavior (#2597).
- **Cache-hit cost accounting uses one telemetry source.** Mixed DeepSeek
  `prompt_cache_hit_tokens` and OpenAI-style `cached_tokens` usage payloads no
  longer infer cache misses from the wrong hit count, avoiding inflated TUI cost
  estimates on cached DeepSeek turns (#2567, #2609).
- **Cygwin/MSYS2 config paths honor exported `$HOME`.** CodeWhale and legacy
  DeepSeek config roots now prefer a non-empty `$HOME` before falling back to the
  platform home resolver, while `CODEWHALE_HOME` remains the strongest explicit
  override (#2369, #2610).

### Community

## [0.8.51] - 2026-06-02

### Added

- **Arcee AI as a direct provider.** New `[providers.arcee]` config block and
  `ARCEE_API_KEY` / `ARCEE_BASE_URL` / `ARCEE_MODEL` environment variables,
  wired through CLI auth (`codewhale auth set --provider arcee`), the TUI
  provider picker, and the model registry. The default direct-API model is
  `trinity-large-thinking` (reasoning-capable, 262K context and 262K max
  output); `trinity-large-preview` (262K context, non-reasoning) and
  `trinity-mini` (128K context) are also selectable. OpenRouter's
  `arcee-ai/trinity-large-thinking` route remains separate.
- **Arcee Cloudflare-WAF compatibility.** The opening turn to the Arcee gateway
  uses a benign read-only tool surface (`read_file`, `list_dir`, `file_search`,
  `grep_files`, `git_status`, `git_diff`, `checklist_write`, `update_plan`) and
  splits example payloads such as `python -c …` out of the system prompt, so the
  WAF does not reject the first request; the full tool catalog stays reachable
  through tool-search. `trinity-large-thinking`'s `reasoning_content` is
  recognized and replayed on tool-call turns.
- **Expanded model catalog.** Added context-window, max-output, and
  reasoning-capability metadata for additional model IDs, including
  `qwen/qwen3.6-flash`, `qwen/qwen3.6-plus`, `qwen/qwen3.6-max-preview`, and
  Xiaomi MiMo v2.5 chat/ASR/TTS variants; `trinity-large-preview`'s context
  window was corrected to 262K.
- **Provider-aware model picker.** The picker groups models by provider, shows
  per-model hints, and remembers a saved model per provider.

### Changed

- **Auto-compaction is now percentage- and model-aware.** The per-model
  threshold helper is `compaction_threshold_for_model_at_percent(model,
  percent)` (replacing the effort-based variant), and the default
  `auto_compact_threshold_percent` is 80%. Auto-compaction defaults on for
  models with a context window of 256K or smaller and stays opt-in for 1M-token
  models (e.g. DeepSeek V4) to protect prefix-cache economics, unless the user
  has explicitly set `auto_compact`.
- **Clearer provider/gateway errors.** HTTP error bodies are sanitized before
  display — HTML interstitials and Cloudflare "Access Denied" pages collapse to
  a one-line reason (with the ray/error ID) instead of dumping raw markup into
  the transcript — and 403s are split into authentication vs. authorization
  (gateway/WAF block) categories.
- The invalid-model error now names the active provider and lists Arcee among
  the options.

- Google Gemini is its own backend (`/provider google`) on the official
  OpenAI-compatible route with thought-signature capture/replay and
  fail-closed replay for thinking models. Antigravity (`agy` 1.1.13) joins
  as a separate credential-plane provider: consent-gated read-only import
  of the official CLI's login with `ANTIGRAVITY_API_KEY`/`AGY_ADC_AUTH`
  precedence; requests fail closed until the cloud-code wire protocol is
  implemented.

### Removed

- **The session "cycle" / checkpoint-restart system.** Removed the `/cycles`,
  `/cycle <n>`, and `/recall` commands, the `recall_archive` tool, the
  cycle-handoff briefing prompt, the sidebar "cycles" lines, and the
  `cycle_manager` engine plumbing (`EngineConfig.cycle`, `Event::CycleAdvanced`,
  seam-manager cycle thresholds and flash briefings). Long sessions no longer
  auto-reset their context at a fixed token boundary — reclaim budget with
  `/compact` or model-aware auto-compaction instead. Existing on-disk cycle
  archives are left untouched but are no longer read or written.

### Fixed

- Assistant turns no longer leave an orphaned role glyph (the stray "blue dot")
  when a turn streams only whitespace between reasoning and a tool call.
- Scrolling the mouse wheel over the right-hand sidebar no longer leaks into the
  transcript scroll.
- The sidebar hover tooltip now appears only for truncated lines, sits below the
  cursor, and uses a neutral surface color instead of the warning-orange
  highlight that overlapped neighbouring rows.
- Corrected the README's description of the Constitution (Article VII is the
  hierarchy itself; Article II's truth duty overrides even a user request) to
  match `prompts/base.md`.
- Repaired release-blocking unit and integration tests left failing by the
  cycle-removal and compaction-threshold refactors (relay instruction,
  model-reject message, compaction budget, mock-LLM threshold helper).
- Fixed DEC private-mode CSI fragment leakage into composer text after
  terminal resets, restoring clean prompt editing (#2592).
- The engine now recovers from turn-level panics instead of killing the
  main event loop, keeping the session alive through transient failures
  (#2583, #1269).
- Deeply nested files are now discoverable via @-mention and Ctrl+P file
  picker; the default walk depth was relaxed to handle monorepo layouts (#2488).
- Command-palette selection stays visible when scrolling through long lists
  instead of scrolling off-screen (#2590).
- exec_shell child processes now inherit .NET/NuGet and Windows app-data
  environment variables, fixing toolchain resolution on Windows (#1857).
- A warning is emitted when shell/sandbox config keys are nested under
  unknown top-level sections instead of being silently ignored (#2589).
- Diff-render now preserves leading whitespace in patch content lines,
  fixing an extra-space regression in PR previews (#2591). Thanks @zlh124.
- Model selection from the /model command now persists per-provider across
  restarts, with a warning when persistence fails.

### Community

Thanks to **@zlh124** (#2591) and **@reidliu41** (#2601) for the fixes
harvested into this release. Thanks also to **@idling11** (#2602),
**@gordonlu** (#2585), **@cyq1017** (#2593), **@xyuai** (#2587, #2584),
and **@IcedOranges** (#2584) for reports, drafts, and investigations
that shaped this release cycle.

## [0.8.50] - 2026-06-02

### Added

- Added a Windows NSIS installer release artifact and classroom/lab deployment
  checklist, harvested from #2045 for #1987. The release workflow now builds
  `CodeWhaleSetup.exe` from the canonical Windows binaries, and the installer
  adds/removes only the exact current-user PATH entry.
- Added deterministic session timestamps in session listings, receipt-export
  boundary docs, and current-model turn metadata for routed/auto sessions.
- Added exact AtlasCloud provider-hinted model ID pass-through for explicit
  `vendor/model-id` selections, harvested from #2569 without freezing a
  brittle provider catalog.
- Added Xiaomi MiMo speech/TTS support with a `codewhale speech` CLI command,
  `tts` tool alias, and config wiring for voice-design and voice-clone models,
  harvested from #2560.
- Added a three-zone immutable prefix diagnostic layer (FrozenPrefix Phase 2)
  that logs cache-prefix drift at debug level without blocking requests,
  harvested from #2514.
- Added a Cache Guard CI integration test suite simulating prefix-cache
  behaviour across nine scenarios, gated behind `CODEWHALE_CACHE_GUARD=1`,
  harvested from #2503.
- Added a plan-mode byte-stability invariant test verifying that the tool
  catalog head remains byte-identical across mode toggles, harvested from
  #2519.
- Localized all 15 `/queue` command messages across 7 shipped locales,
  harvested from #2568.
- Added localized `FanoutCounts` MessageId for i18n of the aggregate worker
  stats line in fanout cards, harvested from #2566.
- Added contribution gate CI workflows (PR gate, issue gate, contributor
  approval) with a dry-run mode, harvested from #2565.

### Changed

- Hardened theme repainting and sidebar color use so theme switches do not
  leave stale Whale-dark panel colors behind.
- Made legacy config migration visible when CodeWhale copies old DeepSeek-era
  config into the CodeWhale config path.

### Fixed

- Fixed `/context` to use the effective routed model for context-window
  budgeting, so DeepSeek V4 routes report the 1M-token window and legacy
  DeepSeek routes keep the 128K fallback.
- Fixed npm wrapper version output so `--version` prefers the installed binary
  version instead of stale package metadata when both are available.
- Fixed multiline composer arrow navigation so holding Up/Down at the first or
  last line no longer replaces the current draft with prompt history.
- Fixed foreground `exec_shell` output collection so timeout and inherited-pipe
  cleanup cannot wedge later tool calls behind the global tool lock.
- Clarified the English DeepSeek account-balance footer chip from `bal` to
  `balance` so it is less likely to be mistaken for session spend.
- Fixed truncated subagent tool calls and repeated truncated subagent responses
  so they return model-visible errors instead of silently failing.
- Moved Paste to the first position in the right-click context menu so users
  copying text from the output area can paste with a single left-click instead
  of navigating past cell-specific actions.

## [0.8.49] - 2026-06-01

### Added

- Added the missing `[providers.moonshot]` example block for Moonshot/Kimi,
  documented `completion_sound`, and refreshed the tool-surface docs for the
  current registry, including `finance`, `web.run`, git history tools, memory,
  OCR, and other registered tools.

### Changed

- Hardened prefix-cache fingerprints to hash API-visible tool schema details,
  not just tool names, so schema and description drift invalidates cached
  prefixes before it can confuse model calls (#2264).
- Kept `finance` registered independently from web-search tools and prevented
  duplicate web/patch tool registration in agent and YOLO modes.

### Fixed

- Fixed the DeepSeek V4-Pro cost estimate after the 2026-05-31 pricing cutoff:
  the post-promotion official rate remains one quarter of the original price,
  so CodeWhale no longer shows roughly 4x too much after June 1 (#2489).
- Fixed Kimi/Moonshot tool schema normalization by moving parent `type` fields
  into `anyOf`/`oneOf` items, with regression coverage for nested schema shapes
  that could otherwise still fail Kimi validation (#2438).
- Fixed raw ANSI/SGR fragments leaking into footer, shell-label, and sidebar
  activity text during active tool execution (#2481).
- Fixed `[tui]` config parsing when `status_items` is omitted, restoring the
  documented default footer order for older and hand-written configs (#2483).
- Fixed a shell env-scrubbing test so it does not depend on the user's default
  shell understanding POSIX parameter expansion.
- Removed stale `qwen/qwen3.7-max` references left in `config.example.toml`
  after the v0.8.48 preset removal.

### Community

**@hongqitai** (#2495), and **@encyc** (#2477) for the fixes and reliability
work harvested into this release.

release: **@A-Corner** (#2438), **@taiwan988** (#2483), **@AiurArtanis**
(#2489), and **@Hmbown** (#2481).

## [0.8.48] - 2026-05-31

### Added

- **Recent large OpenRouter model presets.** Added completions, aliases,
  routing metadata, and docs for Arcee Trinity Large Thinking,
  MiniMax M3, Xiaomi MiMo v2.5, Qwen 3.6 open-weight models, Kimi K2.6,
  GLM 5.1, Tencent Hy3, Gemma 4, and Nemotron (#2461).
- **Provider and web-search expansion.** Added Xiaomi MiMo provider support,
  SiliconFlow, AtlasCloud static models, Volcengine Ark search, Baidu AI
  Search, provider-picker coverage, and richer custom-provider docs
  (#2246, #1868, #2421, #2429, #2371, #2394, #2287).
- **Workflow and tool ergonomics.** Added the external-tool abstraction,
  pluggable TUI tool registry, custom slash-command allowed-tools enforcement,
  opt-in Unix socket hook sink, message-submit transform hooks, tool-cache
  introspection, and cache warmup-key tracking (#2294, #2420, #2326, #2430,
  #2434, #2423, #2424).
- **TUI workflow features.** Added `/purge`, `/hunt`, thinking fold/unfold,
  terminal-transparent/Solarized Light/Claude themes, footer branch display,
  macOS notifications, intent summaries before approval prompts, and the
  mobile runtime smoke/QR workflow (#2387, #2306, #2385, #2276, #2270, #2267,
  #2347, #2260, #2389, #2403).
- **Platform and localization coverage.** Added RISC-V prebuilt-binary
  support, Vietnamese localization, Java/Vue language-server defaults, runtime
  event envelopes, task migration/env isolation fixes, and state-message
  parent IDs for future forks (#2383, #2358, #2367, #2252, #2272, #2308).

- Google Gemini is its own backend (`/provider google`) on the official
  OpenAI-compatible route with thought-signature capture/replay and
  fail-closed replay for thinking models. Antigravity (`agy` 1.1.13) joins
  as a separate credential-plane provider: consent-gated read-only import
  of the official CLI's login with `ANTIGRAVITY_API_KEY`/`AGY_ADC_AUTH`
  precedence; requests fail closed until the cloud-code wire protocol is
  implemented.

### Removed

- **Qwen 3.7 Max OpenRouter preset.** Removed from the model registry, docs,
  and examples. Qwen 3.7 Max is a hosted model, not open-source; the preset
  will return when an open-weight Qwen 3.7 release ships.

### Changed

- **Release hardening.** CI now runs clippy/docs checks, web frontend lint and
  type checks, provider-registry drift checks, broader crate docs, and a large
  unit-test pass across core, MCP, TUI core, app-server, and web helpers
  (#2443, #2444, #2274, #2446-#2460, #2440, #2441, #2450, #2448, #2454).
- **Prompt, context, and model routing behavior.** Stabilized project-context
  pack ordering, exposed the auto route in turn metadata, allowed embedders to
  override or inline constitutional instructions, moved volatile environment
  context below the prompt boundary, and used the effective model for
  compaction budgeting (#2418, #2410, #2356, #2311, #2314, #2437).
- **Execution policy foundation.** Added typed ask-rule groundwork and kept
  `task_shell_start` gated behind `allow_shell`, preparing the permission UI
  path without broadening default shell access (#2404, #2384).

### Fixed

- **Windows and shell reliability.** Suppressed alt-screen logging on Windows,
  added the Windows batch launcher path, kept task shell tools eagerly loaded,
  loaded exec-shell companion tools consistently, covered controlling-terminal
  behavior, and improved shell tool availability errors (#2259, #2295, #1861,
  #2271, #2331, #2414, #2412).
- **Session and transcript durability.** Fixed hidden-worktree discovery
  saturation, stalled in-progress turn recovery, session persistence
  truncation, cached-transcript user-message highlighting, large tool-output
  receipting, session-detail block serialization, and deterministic composer
  history flushing (#2273, #2329, #2283, #2395, #2386, #2297, #2265, #2375).
- **Provider and UI polish.** Accepted custom model IDs in `/model` for
  non-DeepSeek providers, fixed Feishu per-chat model switching, localized
  context-menu labels, updated terminal tab naming, kept picker selections
  visible, allowed slash-space composer messages, and improved PDF text
  cleanup (#2280, #2149, #2320, #2319, #2324, #2316, #2266).
- **Security and dependency hygiene.** Bumped `tar` and `qs`, trusted fake-IP
  placeholder ranges only when explicitly configured, decoded Bing result URL
  entities, fixed legacy MCP SSE connections, and replaced manual tool error
  display code with `thiserror` derives (#2364, #2425, #2355, #2245, #2301,
  #2442).

## [0.8.47] - 2026-05-26

### Added

- **Closed-loop verification gate, runtime goal tools, DuckDuckGo default
  web search, Xiaomi MiMo, global AGENTS.md fallback, `/new`, composer
  selection, transcript copy cleanup, CNB mirror support, and Docker toolbox
  docs** shipped in the published v0.8.47 release.

### Changed

- **DeepSeek-first release framing, project-context logging, state-root
  migration, CodeWhale README paths, and reasoning-locale behavior** were
  finalized for the v0.8.47 release.

### Fixed

- **Provider picker scrolling, auto model restore, cache-inspect hashing,
  insecure LAN provider guard, large tool-output compaction, queued-message
  ordering, shell/Yolo startup handling, Windows alt-screen logging, and
  tooltip contrast** were fixed in the v0.8.47 release.

### Community

## [0.8.46] - 2026-05-26

### Added

- **`CODEWHALE_*` env aliases.** `CODEWHALE_PROVIDER`, `CODEWHALE_MODEL`,
  and `CODEWHALE_BASE_URL` are public product-scoped aliases that take
  precedence over the legacy `DEEPSEEK_*` forms. The `DEEPSEEK_*` names
  remain accepted for back-compat.
- **Platform archive bundles.** Release artifacts now ship as per-platform
  archives (`tar.gz` for Linux/macOS, `.zip` for Windows) containing both
  `codewhale` and `codewhale-tui` binaries plus an install script. No more
  downloading two loose files and guessing which ones to pick (#2193).
- **Windows portable archive.** `codewhale-windows-x64-portable.zip` ships
  the two binaries without an install script for USB-stick distribution
  (#2193).
- **Web install download tile.** The website install page now shows a
  platform-aware download tile with arch detection, SHA256 checksum
  display, and China mirror links, instead of burying the download behind
  the Cargo instructions (#2192).
- **Whale dark palette refresh.** Better contrast and layer separation
  across the TUI color scheme (#2197).
- **Auto-collapse finished sub-agents.** Completed sub-agent sessions now
  collapse automatically in the sidebar, reducing noise during long
  sessions (#2195).
- **Shell-running status chip.** A `⏳ shell running` chip appears in the
  TUI footer while background shell tasks are active (#2194).
- **Sandbox process hardening (Linux).** `PR_SET_DUMPABLE=0`,
  `NO_NEW_PRIVS`, and `RLIMIT_CORE=0` are applied at shell startup to
  harden child processes against inspection and privilege escalation
  (#2183).
- **CONTRIBUTING.md cross-links.** Issue and PR templates are now
  cross-linked from CONTRIBUTING.md to improve contributor onboarding
  (#2203).

### Changed

- **DeepSeek-first focus.** v0.8.46 refocuses on delivering the
  highest-quality experience on DeepSeek first. Additional first-class
  provider paths are planned for v0.9.0 after the core DeepSeek workflow
  is solid.

### Fixed

- **Model name casing preserved.** `normalize_model_name_for_provider` no
  longer lowercases user-set model names such as `DeepSeek-V4-Flash`,
  preventing API lookup failures on case-sensitive backends (#2109).
- **Esc in model picker applies selection.** Dismissing the model picker
  with Esc now applies the last-highlighted choice instead of reverting
  (#2196).
- **Web install downloads both binaries.** The `install-binary.tsx`
  snippet now fetches both `codewhale` and `codewhale-tui`, fixing the
  `MISSING_COMPANION_BINARY` trap on fresh npm installs (#2191).
- **`grep_files` skips large directories.** The pure-Rust search tool
  now skips known-large directories (`.git`, `node_modules`, `target`)
  before walking, preventing hangs on deep or slow filesystems.
- **Version-update hint uses semver.** The update notification in the
  footer now compares versions semantically instead of lexicographically,
  so `0.8.10 > 0.8.9` is recognized correctly.
- **CVE-2026-8723 in feishu-bridge.** Bumped `qs` to `>=6.15.2` in the
  Feishu bridge integration (#2198).

## [0.8.45] - 2026-05-25

### Added

- **RLM session objects.** `rlm_open` can now load `session://` refs,
  exposing the active prompt, history, and session data as symbolic objects
  inside RLM REPLs (#2047).
- **Command palette voice input.** The command palette can launch a configured
  speech-to-text helper and show footer status while transcription runs
  (#2047).
- **Moonshot/Kimi provider.** Moonshot/Kimi is now a first-class provider,
  including API-key auth, model completion, CLI auth, secret-store
  integration, and optional Kimi CLI credential reuse.
- **Deterministic whale-species sub-agent names.** Sub-agents now get stable,
  human-readable whale-species nicknames (e.g. "Beluga", "Orca") while
  preserving the raw agent ID in the popup (#2035, #2016).
- **`/balance` command scaffold.** Registered the `/balance` slash command
  as a placeholder for future provider billing queries (#2035, #2019).
- **Readable `/restore` snapshot labels.** Snapshot labels now include the
  originating user prompt so restore listings are easier to identify. Thanks
  @idling11 (#2111).
- **Sidebar hover tooltips.** Truncated Work and Tasks sidebar lines now expose
  their full text on hover. Thanks @idling11 (#2110).

### Changed

- **AGENTS.md is now maintainer-local.** The project instructions file no
  longer ships as a tracked repo file; it lives in maintainer-local ignored
  state (#2047).

### Fixed

- **Sub-agent completion handoff compatibility.** Completion handoffs now use a
  chat-template-safe role and emit before terminal updates, fixing strict
  OpenAI-compatible/self-hosted backends and preserving transcript ordering.
  Thanks @h3c-hexin and @cyq1017 (#2057, #2120).
- **Self-hosted context budgeting.** Sub-500K self-hosted model windows now keep
  a usable input budget instead of disabling preflight compaction after output
  reservation underflow. Thanks @h3c-hexin (#2060).
- **Goal prompts start actionable.** Goal-start prompts now open in an
  actionable state instead of requiring an extra nudge. Thanks @cyq1017
  (#2097).
- **Composer session title display.** The composer chrome shows the current
  session title again and avoids grayscale luma overflow in debug builds.
  Thanks @wdw8276 (#2108).
- **Approval prompts use a one-step confirmation flow.** Enter now commits the
  selected approval option directly, destructive warnings remain visible, and
  abort cancels the active turn instead of only denying the current tool call.
  Thanks @reidliu41 (#2143).
- **Model picker selection survives Esc.** Dismissing the model picker with Esc
  no longer loses the highlighted selection. Thanks @reidliu41 (#2056).
- **Moonshot/Kimi sessions launch from the dispatcher.** The `codewhale`
  wrapper now includes Moonshot/Kimi in the TUI provider allowlist, so
  `codewhale --provider moonshot --model kimi-k2.6` reaches the TUI instead of
  stopping after config resolution.
- **Slash recovery no longer restores command tails in the composer.**
  Resuming a session or recovering from a crash no longer leaves stale
  slash-command text (e.g. `/sessions`) in the composer input (#2047, #2032).
- **Remembered tool approvals now update the live active turn.**
  When the "remember" checkbox is set on an approval dialog, the active
  turn's auto-approve flag flips immediately instead of waiting for the
  next turn. Thanks @gaord (#2047, #2041).
- **YAML block scalars in SKILL.md frontmatter.** Multi-line descriptions
  using `>` or `|` indicators are now parsed correctly — folded block
  scalars join non-empty lines with spaces, literal scalars preserve
  newlines, and all three chomping modes (strip/clip/keep) are supported.
  Thanks @zlh124 (#1908, #1907).
- **User messages highlighted in the transcript.** User-authored messages
  now render with a full-row background in the live TUI transcript, making
  it easier to scan prior turns. Assistant and system messages are
  unaffected. Thanks @reidliu41 (#1995, #1672).
- **Cancellable `list_dir` and `file_search`.** Long directory walks and
  file searches now respond to user cancel/stop requests with a 30-second
  fallback timeout, preventing the TUI from hanging on deep or slow
  filesystems (#2035).

### Community

- **README contributor acknowledgements resynced.** The Thanks list now
  includes the latest contributor rows for @donglovejava, @encyc,
  @saieswar237, @sximelon, @nanookclaw, @Sskift, @xin1104, @mrluanma,
  @Lellansin, and @zhuangbiaowei, while preserving the existing @jeoor
  acknowledgement in the consolidated list.

## [0.8.44] - 2026-05-24

### Added

- **`codew` convenience alias.** `codew` is a short-form command that silently
  forwards to `codewhale`. Six fewer keystrokes, same binary. Ships with the
  Rust `codewhale-cli` crate and the npm `codewhale` package (#2013).
- **Session picker inline rename.** Press `r` in the session picker (Ctrl+R)
  to rename the selected session inline. Type the new title, Enter to confirm,
  Esc to cancel (#1600).
- **Plan detail display.** The \"Plan Confirmation\" modal now shows the plan
  explanation and step list from `update_plan` so you can review what was
  proposed before accepting (#834).
- **Agent team UX.** Delegate cards in the transcript now show human-readable
  roles (scout, builder, reviewer, verifier, executor) and the completion
  summary instead of raw `agent_xxx` IDs (#1981).
- **`--continue` / `-c` CLI flag.** `codewhale --continue` resumes your most
  recent interactive session for the current workspace.

### Changed

- **App state migrates to `~/.codewhale/`.** New installs write product-owned
  state (config, sessions, tasks, skills, logs, etc.) under `~/.codewhale/`.
  `~/.deepseek/` continues to work as a compatibility fallback — no data loss,
  no forced migration. `CODEWHALE_HOME` and `CODEWHALE_CONFIG_PATH` env vars
  are now supported alongside existing `DEEPSEEK_*` vars (#2011).
- **Project config overlay prefers `.codewhale/config.toml`** before
  `.deepseek/config.toml`. Both are read; the CodeWhale root takes precedence.
- **Doctor reports active state root** and whether legacy `~/.deepseek/`
  state is also present.
- **README contributor acknowledgements are current for this release.**
  Thanks @jeoor, @LING71671, and @ousamabenyounes for the fixes and reports
  now reflected in the public credits.
- **Harvested-contribution credit audit completed.** The README Thanks list now
  includes previously missed community helpers whose code, reports, or review
  notes were already credited in older changelog entries but not in the public
  contributor surface: @mvanhorn, @krisclarkdev, @tdccccc, @LittleBlacky,
  @AnaheimEX, @THatch26, @alvin1, @knqiufan, @IIzzaya, @duanchao-lab,
  @imkingjh999, @eng2007, @chennest, @kunpeng-ai-lab, @asdfg314284230,
  @maker316, @lalala-233, @muyuliyan, @czf0718, @MeAiRobot, @tiger-dog,
  @MMMarcinho, @lucaszhu-hue, @sandofree, @zhuangbiaowei, @NorethSea,
  @Jianfengwu2024, @Fire-dtx, @oooyuy92, @qinxianyuzou, @tyouter,
  @xulongzhe, @YaYII, @47Cid, and @JafarAkhondali.
- **Harvest guidance now requires GitHub-visible attribution.** Maintainer
  harvests should preserve the original commit author where possible or add
  `Co-authored-by` trailers from the original PR commits, in addition to the
  existing `Harvested from PR #N by @handle` trailer and changelog credit.
- **Enter now steers when busy-waiting.** When the model is busy but not
  actively streaming (waiting on tool results, sub-agents, or shell
  commands), pressing Enter tries to steer your message into the current
  turn instead of silently queueing it. During active streaming, Enter
  still queues to avoid interrupting in-flight reasoning (#2009).

### Fixed

- **`/save` no longer creates repo-local `session_*.json`.** Default saves
  now go to the managed sessions directory instead of the current workspace.
  Explicit `/save path/to/file.json` exports still work as before (#2010).
- **Boot-time session prune** caps managed sessions at 50 on every startup,
  preventing unbounded growth of `~/.codewhale/sessions/`.
- **Checkpoint path resolution** no longer hardcodes `~/.deepseek/` — uses
  the resolved session directory instead.
- **Plain startup no longer auto-opens the session picker.** `codewhale` and
  `codew` start in a fresh composer again even when saved sessions exist.
  Use `/sessions`, Ctrl+R, `--resume`, or `--continue` when you want to resume.
- **Work sidebar now refreshes immediately** after `checklist_write`,
  `checklist_update`, and `update_plan` tool calls, matching the existing
  `todo_write` behavior instead of relying on the 2.5s periodic poll (#1787).

## [0.8.43] - 2026-05-24

### Fixed

- **`grep_files` now respects the cancellation token.** Long-running file
  searches cancel promptly instead of running to completion after the user
  aborts (#1839). Thanks @LING71671.
- **npm installer stream-pause race condition fixed.** The install script now
  pauses HTTP response streams immediately, preventing early data loss that
  caused "Invalid checksum manifest line" errors (#1860). Thanks @jeoor.
- **Ctrl+Z restores the last cleared composer draft.** Pressing Ctrl+Z in an
  empty composer recovers the text that was last cleared with Ctrl+U or
  Ctrl+S, matching the muscle memory users expect from other editors (#1911).
  Thanks @LING71671.
- **Clipboard works on non-wlroots Wayland compositors.** The Linux clipboard
  path now tries `wl-copy` before `arboard`, fixing silent copy failures on
  niri, River, cosmic-comp, and GNOME mutter (#1938). Thanks @ousamabenyounes.

### Added

- **`/goal` remains the persistent objective surface.** Use `/goal <objective>`
  to set a goal and `/goal done` to mark it complete. Goal status appears in
  the Work sidebar with elapsed time, but it does not change Plan / Agent /
  YOLO mode or approval behavior. A tabbed Ralph-style Goal loop is deferred to
  v0.8.44 (#2007).
- **Post-turn receipts cite evidence for every completed turn.** When a turn
  finishes, a receipt line shows in the transcript tail with a summary of
  tool calls, file changes, and evidence that supports the agent's claims.
  Tool evidence is collected per-turn and flushed on new dispatch.
- **Stall reason classification.** When a turn has been running for more than
  30 seconds, the footer now appends a classified reason: "waiting for model",
  "tools executing", "sub-agents working", "compacting context", or "waiting —
  no recent activity".
- **Decision card widget for structured user input.** When Brother Whale needs
  a choice, it surfaces a bordered card with numbered options, keyboard
  navigation (1-9 / j/k / arrows), and Enter/Esc to confirm or cancel.
- **Tasks sidebar now shows fuller turn IDs and supports copy-to-clipboard.**
  Turn ID prefixes are widened from 12 to 16 characters for disambiguation,
  background job status is presented as "X running, Y completed" instead of
  ambiguous "X active (Y running)", and `y` / `Y` yank affordances copy the
  current turn ID or full status line to the system clipboard (#1975).

### Changed

- **Contributor count and acknowledgement surfaces refreshed.** The website
  fallback contributor count now reflects 98 live GitHub contributors (up from
  the stale 91). All three README translations (English, 中文, 日本語) now
  include 30+ previously unlisted contributors whose PRs were merged since
  April 2026.
- **README and web surface rebrand refinements.** Crate descriptions, npm
  package text, and website copy now consistently position CodeWhale as
  open-model-first and provider-spanning, with DeepSeek V4 as the first-class
  path.
- **New contributor names added to README acknowledgements.** Thanks to
  @Apeiron0w0, @aqilaziz, @ChaceLyee2101, @ComeFromTheMars, @CrepuscularIRIS,
  @dst1213, @eltociear, @fuleinist, @greyfreedom, @h3c-hexin, @heloanc,
  @hxy91819, @J3y0r, @JiarenWang, @jinpengxuan, @KhalidAlnujaidi, @laoye2020,
  @lbcheng888, @linzhiqin2003, @Liu-Vince, @lixiasky-back, @pengyou200902,
  @punkcanyang, @Rene-Kuhm, @SamhandsomeLee, @sockerch, @sternelee,
  @Wenjunyun123, @whtis, and @wuwuzhijing for the translations, typo fixes,
  docs polish, and small UX improvements that landed across the 0.8.42 →
  0.8.43 cycle.

### Security

- **Thinking blocks can be collapsed/expanded via keyboard.** Space on an
  empty composer toggles the focused thinking cell between collapsed and
  expanded, complementing the existing mouse right-click context menu (#1972).
- **Sub-agent completion events no longer delayed to the next turn.** The turn
  loop now drains late-arriving sub-agent completions at the final checkpoint
  before breaking, so child-agent sentinels surface immediately instead of
  appearing in the following turn (#1961).
- **`codewhale doctor` now referenced correctly in SSE timeout errors.**
  The error message shown when SSE streams fail to connect now points users to
  `codewhale doctor` (not the legacy `deepseek doctor`).

## [0.8.42] - 2026-05-24

### Changed

- **CodeWhale now ships with the Brother Whale agent identity prompt.** The
  built-in system prompt frames the agent as trusted, calm, careful, and
  responsible, and adds the coordination principle that great intelligence
  creates spaces where future intelligences can work together.
- **CodeWhale positioning is clarified as DeepSeek-first and open-model
  oriented.** README, rebrand notes, crate metadata, and npm package text now
  describe CodeWhale as an agentic terminal for open source and open-weight
  coding models while preserving the official DeepSeek provider as first-class.
- **Model auto-routing is documented separately from TUI modes.** README and
  modes docs now reserve "mode" for Plan / Agent / YOLO, describe
  `--model auto` as model/thinking routing, and name the fast
  `deepseek-v4-flash` thinking-off seam as Fin.
- **Rebrand shim docs now match the v0.8.x transition window.** The npm and
  migration notes no longer imply the legacy `deepseek-tui` package/shims
  expired immediately after v0.8.41.

### Fixed

- **User-authored messages render as literal plain text.** Leading whitespace,
  whitespace-only lines, repeated spaces, and Markdown-looking `#` / `-` text
  now survive in transcript history, while assistant messages still render
  Markdown normally.
- **English turns stay English after localized context.** The Brother Whale
  identity and base language rules no longer inject native-script examples into
  the English prompt path, and the prompt now calls out localized READMEs, issue
  text, file contents, and tool results as data rather than language signals.
- **Stream decode failures no longer leave the turn visually stuck.** The UI
  now marks an active turn failed and flushes live cells as soon as the engine
  emits a stream error, so the sidebar/footer recover without requiring
  Ctrl+C (#1960).
- **RLM contexts now expose `_ctx`.** Persistent RLM REPLs bind `_ctx` as a
  compatibility alias for the loaded source alongside `_context` and
  `content`, and the prompt/docs call out the exact names (#1962).
- **`handle_read` is easier to recover from.** The tool keeps accepting full
  `var_handle` objects directly, adds `introspect: true` for size/projection
  hints, and validation failures now include copy-pasteable examples (#1963).
- **The help picker keeps the selected row visible while scrolling.** `/help`
  now budgets against the real modal body height, wraps Up/Down navigation,
  and uses a stronger selected-row highlight (#1964).
- **Unicode `git_status` paths stay readable.** Chinese and other non-ASCII
  repository paths now survive status parsing and display cleanly (#1936,
  #1953).
- **Project-local and configured skills appear in the slash menu.** Workspace
  skills and configured skill directories now feed the command picker instead
  of only the bundled set (#1955, #1956).
- **Repeated Tab mode switching no longer stacks composer-obscuring toasts.**
  The mode-switch notification now deduplicates instead of accumulating rows
  over the composer (#1926, #1957).
- **Local tool UX surfaces are clearer.** `github_close_pr` now has the same
  guarded closure workflow as issue close, `handle_read` redirects artifact
  refs to `retrieve_tool_result`, Plan handoffs use plainer wording, and shell
  rows/sidebar tasks show the actual running command instead of placeholder
  labels.

### Thanks

Thanks to **cyq ([@cyq1017](https://github.com/cyq1017))** for the Unicode
`git_status`, local/configured skill discovery, and mode-switch toast fixes in
#1953, #1956, and #1957. Thanks to **Reid
([@reidliu41](https://github.com/reidliu41))** for the help picker scrolling
and selection fix in #1964.

## [0.8.41] - 2026-05-23

### Changed

- **Project renamed to codewhale.** The canonical CLI dispatcher is now
  `codewhale` (was `deepseek`) and the TUI runtime is `codewhale-tui`
  (was `deepseek-tui`). The 14 workspace crates are renamed from
  `deepseek-*` / `deepseek-tui-*` to `codewhale-*` / `codewhale-tui-*`.
  The npm wrapper package is now `codewhale` (was `deepseek-tui`). See
  [docs/REBRAND.md](docs/REBRAND.md) for migration notes.
- **DeepSeek provider integration is unchanged.** `DEEPSEEK_*` env vars,
  model IDs (`deepseek-v4-pro`, `deepseek-v4-flash`, the legacy
  `deepseek-chat` / `deepseek-reasoner` aliases), the
  `https://api.deepseek.com` host, and the `~/.deepseek/` config
  directory are all preserved.

### Deprecated

- The `deepseek` and `deepseek-tui` binary names continue to ship as
  tiny shims that print a one-line warning and forward argv to the
  renamed binaries. They will be removed in v0.9.0.
- The `deepseek-tui` npm package continues to publish for one release
  cycle as a no-`bin` deprecation shim whose postinstall directs users
  to `npm install -g codewhale`. It will be removed in v0.9.0.

### Fixed

- **Windows CI spillover tests are isolated.** Tool-result deduplication
  tests now use a temporary spillover root guarded by the existing global
  spillover mutex, removing the shared-state race that made Windows CI fail
  unrelated PRs (#1943).
- **Terminated sub-agents keep `agent_eval` recoverable.** Evaluating a
  completed child session now returns the available transcript result instead
  of losing the final output (#1738, #1928).
- **Bare `@/` completions no longer freeze the TUI.** File-mention
  completion skips bare separator and dot tokens so Windows/WSL2 workspaces
  do not trigger an eager 4096-entry filesystem walk on the UI thread
  (#1921, #1929).
- **Enter paths avoid synchronous UI-thread waits.** Composer history writes,
  offline queue persistence, feedback URL launching, and clipboard fallback
  helpers now run off the hot Enter path where appropriate (#1927, #1931,
  #1940, #1941, #1944).
- **tmux and screen sessions stop idling as terminal activity.** Terminal
  multiplexers now force low-motion behavior and pin the fallback footer label
  so passive animations do not trip activity monitors (#1925, #1942).
- **Composer sanitization catches OSC 8 and Kitty fragments.** The input
  sanitizer now strips common hyperlink and keyboard-protocol fragments that
  leaked into drafts while preserving ordinary prose (#1915, #1933).
- **The Work sidebar hides stale completed tasks.** Terminal task records older
  than the current session and outside the recent-completion window no longer
  crowd active Work sidebar rows (#1913, #1930).
- **V4 Pro pricing docs reflect permanent rates.** The English, Simplified
  Chinese, and Japanese READMEs now describe the V4 Pro pricing change as
  permanent instead of temporary (#1923, #1932).

### Thanks

Thanks to **OpenWarp ([@zerx-lab](https://github.com/zerx-lab))** for
prioritizing codewhale support and collaborating on terminal-agent UX.
Thanks to **[@leo119](https://github.com/leo119)** for the update-command
documentation lineage now preserved through the rename.

## [0.8.40] - 2026-05-21

### Added

- **Configurable sub-agent per-step API timeout.** A new
  `[subagents] api_timeout_secs` setting in `~/.deepseek/config.toml`
  controls how long each sub-agent step will wait on a DeepSeek
  `create_message` response before falling back. The value is clamped to
  `1..=1800`; `0` or unset preserves the legacy 120-second default, so
  existing installs see no behavior change. Long-thinking children (e.g.
  heavy plan or review work behind `agent_open`) can extend the timeout
  without recompiling (#1806, #1808).
- **Delegated file-write permissions for write-capable sub-agent roles.**
  `implementer` and `custom` sub-agents may now run `Suggest`-level write
  tools (`write_file`, `edit_file`, `apply_patch`) without the parent
  runtime being auto-approved. Read-only stances (`explore`, `plan`,
  `review`, `verifier`) and the default `general` role still bounce
  approval-gated tools so they can't quietly mutate the workspace, and
  `Required`-level tools (shell, etc.) still need parent auto-approve
  regardless of role. Pick `implementer` (or pass an explicit `custom`
  allowlist) when the delegated task needs to land file changes
  (#1828, #1833).
- **Experimental Fin fast-lane tool agents.** `tool_agent` opens a durable
  child session on DeepSeek V4 Flash with thinking forced off for simple
  tool-bound work such as OCR, file/search lookups, fetches, and command
  probes. It uses the existing `agent_eval` / `agent_close` lifecycle and
  mailbox token-usage stream, so sub-agent cost accounting stays on the same
  path as normal `agent_open` sessions.

### Fixed

- **WSL2 and headless Linux startup no longer blocks on clipboard init.** The
  TUI now defers clipboard initialization so machines without an X server can
  reach the first frame instead of hanging on a blank screen (#1773, #1772).
- **Windows alt-screen output stays clean when `RUST_LOG` is set.** Runtime
  tracing is routed away from the interactive buffer so logs no longer leak
  into the TUI display (#1774, #1776).
- **OpenAI-compatible custom model names are preserved.** Non-DeepSeek
  providers now pass explicit model names through instead of rewriting them to
  a DeepSeek default (#1714, #1740).
- **Wanjie Ark is a first-class provider.** `--provider wanjie-ark`, the TUI
  provider picker, `deepseek auth`, doctor, and config files now target
  Wanjie's OpenAI-compatible MaaS endpoint with pass-through model IDs and
  Wanjie-specific env vars.
- **DeepSeek reasoning replay works through OpenAI-compatible endpoints.**
  DeepSeek models selected under the generic `openai` provider now replay
  prior `reasoning_content` consistently and classify streamed reasoning the
  same way the replay path does (#1694, #1739, #1743).
- **Thinking-only turns no longer disappear.** If a clean turn ends with
  thinking but no final answer text, the UI now surfaces a clear status instead
  of silently ending the turn (#1727, #1742).
- **Windows `cmd /C` preserves quoted shell arguments.** Commands such as
  `git commit -m "feat: complete sub-pages"` now round-trip through the Windows
  shell wrapper without losing the quoted message (#1691, #1744).
- **Home/End are line-local inside multiline composer drafts.** The keys now
  jump to the current input line boundary before falling back to transcript
  navigation (#1748, #1749).
- **Ctrl+C restores the canceled prompt reliably.** Canceling a streaming turn
  puts the submitted prompt back in the composer and suppresses late stream
  events from drawing stale output (#1757, #1764).
- **Compaction recovers from cache-aligned summary context overflow.** When a
  cache-preserving summary request itself exceeds the provider context window,
  compaction retries with the bounded formatted summary path instead of failing
  with a 400 "compression command failed" style error.
- **Terminal sub-agent sessions expose full transcript handles.** Completed
  and canceled child agents now store the full child message transcript behind
  `transcript_handle`, so the parent can inspect details with `handle_read`
  instead of relying only on a lossy summary (#1738).
- **Forked saved sessions now keep visible lineage.** `deepseek fork` records
  the parent session id and fork-time message count in additive metadata, and
  session listings mark forked paths with their source id. This gives users a
  bounded branchable-conversation workflow while the larger visual tree browser
  stays scoped for a future release.
- **Repeated shell wait rows collapse in the Tasks sidebar.** Multiple live
  `task_shell_wait` polls for the same background job now render as one row
  with an explicit collapsed-wait count, reducing the stuck-task appearance
  tracked for v0.8.40 (#1737).
- **Leaked mouse scroll reports no longer erase composer draft suffixes.** If
  a terminal delivers raw SGR mouse bytes into the input stream, the sanitizer
  now strips only the mouse report and adjacent coordinate fragments instead
  of deleting legitimate draft text such as `commit -m` or numeric prompts
  (#1778).
- **TUI runtime logs are separated per process and pruned on startup.** Each
  session now writes `~/.deepseek/logs/tui-YYYY-MM-DD-PID.log`, and startup
  removes stale TUI logs older than seven days by default. Set
  `DEEPSEEK_LOG_RETENTION_DAYS` to a positive day count to adjust retention
  (#1782, #1784).
- **The offline eval harness preserves quoted Windows shell payloads.** Its
  `exec_shell` step now uses the same single-payload shape as the runtime shell
  path, with raw `cmd /C` arguments on Windows so quoted commands remain intact
  (#1779).
- **The Feishu/Lark bridge recovers better after restarts.** It now reattaches
  to persisted active turns after the long-connection client starts, and text
  chunking no longer splits emoji or other multi-code-unit characters.
- **RLM survives non-UTF-8 stdout.** `rlm_eval` now decodes REPL stdout
  lossily instead of treating a single invalid byte as a fatal crash, so
  binary-adjacent diagnostics can still return a bounded result (#1815,
  #1819).
- **Small UI/review reliability fixes landed with the stability branch.**
  `/clear` now resets all displayed cost state, grayscale theme previews avoid
  luma overflow, `/theme` picker arrow navigation wraps at the list edges, and
  encoded JSON review output is parsed before display.
- **New-file writes execute on the first Agent-mode call.** `write_file` now
  stays preloaded in Agent mode, so creating a file no longer stops at the
  deferred-tool schema hydration message before the normal approval/execution
  path (#1825, #1841).
- **Saved sessions keep the selected model mode.** Changing from `auto` to a
  concrete model now updates existing session metadata, and resumed sessions
  recompute the `auto` flag from the saved model instead of falling back to the
  startup default.
- **The `/model` picker persists thinking effort across restarts.** Selecting
  Pro/Flash plus `high`/`max`/`auto` now writes both `default_model` and
  `reasoning_effort` to `settings.toml`, and startup restores the saved effort
  before falling back to `config.toml`.
- **The footer water strip is visible by default again.** `fancy_animations`
  now defaults to `true`, while `NO_ANIMATIONS`, SSH/Termius, VS Code, Ghostty,
  and legacy terminal overrides still disable the animated strip where it is
  known to flicker.
- **Screenshots are readable without extra setup on macOS.** `image_ocr` now
  uses the native Vision framework on macOS when Tesseract is absent, and
  `read_file` routes screenshot/image reads through the same OCR path. Pasted
  clipboard screenshots saved under `~/.deepseek/clipboard-images` are trusted
  automatically for read-only tools.
- **Auto-routing context no longer leaks hidden thinking.** The model/router
  context summary now excludes `ContentBlock::Thinking`, so prior internal
  reasoning is not reintroduced as if it were visible user or assistant text.

### Changed

- **Slash-command autocomplete ranks exact alias matches first.** Typing
  `/q` now surfaces `/exit` (whose alias `q` is an exact match) above
  `/clear` (which only matches by the longer pinyin alias `qingping`).
  Within each rank tier the menu still falls back to alphabetical name
  order for deterministic display (#1811).
- **CNB mirror preflight covers stability-release branches.** The CNB sync
  path now recognizes the v0.8.40 stability branch shape before release tags
  exist, making the Tencent Lighthouse/Lark deployment path easier to verify
  before publishing.

### Thanks

Thanks to **jayzhu ([@zlh124](https://github.com/zlh124))** for the WSL2
startup report and clipboard-init fix in #1772/#1773. Thanks to **Paulo Aboim
Pinto ([@aboimpinto](https://github.com/aboimpinto))** for the Windows
alt-screen logging report and fix in #1774/#1776, and for the Home/End
composer work in #1748/#1749, plus the per-process log filename follow-up in
#1782/#1783. Thanks to **Zhongyue Lin
([@LeoLin990405](https://github.com/LeoLin990405))** for the provider model
passthrough, reasoning replay, thinking-only turn, and Windows quoting fixes
in #1740, #1743, #1742, and #1744. Thanks to **Nightt
([@nightt5879](https://github.com/nightt5879))** for the Ctrl+C prompt restore
fix in #1764. Thanks to **Ling ([@LING71671](https://github.com/LING71671);
commits as `www17 <ivonrust@gmail.com>`)** for the configurable sub-agent API
timeout in #1808 and the Agent-mode `write_file` preload fix in #1841,
harvested with `1..=1800` clamping and a fail-fast guard so a stray
`api_timeout_secs = 0` keeps the legacy 120-second default.
Thanks to **[@knqiufan](https://github.com/knqiufan)** for the sub-agent
file-write delegation work in #1833, harvested with structured approval-
gate semantics (`Implementer` and `Custom` only, never `Required`-level
tools) so write-capable children can actually land code without bypassing
the `Required` approval class. Thanks to **[@IIzzaya](https://github.com/IIzzaya)**
for the exact-alias-first slash-completion ordering idea in #1811, landed
with a focused regression test. Thanks to **Bevis** and the community reports
that surfaced the compaction failure mode addressed in this release. Thanks to
**Reid ([@reidliu41](https://github.com/reidliu41))** for the grayscale theme
overflow report and `/theme` picker edge-wrapping patch in #1814.
